Coalition Troops Penetrate Outskirts of Baghdad
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> WOODRUFF </SPEAKER>
Well, U.S. forces entering Baghdad do face the prospect of urban combat,
a type of battle they have trained for, but, of course, they would prefer
to avoid. For more now on the unique challenges posed by urban combat,
let's go back to Atlanta and join the man whose voice we just heard,
Miles O'Brien. Hello again, Miles.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> O'BRIEN </SPEAKER>
Hello again, Judy. I'm joined by J. Kelly McCann, our security analyst, a
man who's spent a lot of time learning about urban combat. You know, just
those two words together, I think, scare a lot of people because of all
the things that can go wrong. You know, I'm impressed, looking at this
map, it almost looks like a chess game, kind of sterile. That is --
couldn't be further from the truth, could it?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> J. KELLY MCCANN, CNN SECURITY ANALYST </SPEAKER>
Absolutely not. This is very clean and it's very orderly. Suddenly when
we show the videotape and we start to go there, you'll see just how
conflicted an environment that is.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> O'BRIEN </SPEAKER>
And all happening so quickly.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> MCCANN </SPEAKER>
(UNINTELLIGIBLE).
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> O'BRIEN </SPEAKER>
Let's roll some tape. We're going to kind of play it and stop it, and
Kelly's going to walk us through, I guess, Urban Combat 101. What are we
seeing here?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> MCCANN </SPEAKER>
Just there, I mean, just getting the door out of the way, you can see
where the weapons have to go. Now, you just see this soldier right here,
he's going to his sidearm to make a little bit more mobile. And he's got
to be careful of his muzzle pointing at his partner right here. Now, he's
going to go that direction, because that room is clear. Go ahead and stop
the tape.As you make every entry, Miles, there are two dead spots, one,
of course, in this direction right here, which you can't see from the
doorway, the other in this direction right here, and that's always the
problem, because as you come in here, you've got to be able to get in
there quickly and make sure that this person here doesn't get shot in the
back. So...
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> O'BRIEN </SPEAKER>
All right. Now, what about this, this armor? Tell us how they're equipped
with armor there.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> MCCANN </SPEAKER>
Level 4 armor, this is not just for frag. This will also stop bullets.
And there's a difference. The normal flak jacket will stop fragments from
grenades, et cetera. This is a plate that will actually stop and deform a
bullet.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> O'BRIEN </SPEAKER>
All right. Let's roll tape and continue on here and talk about -- Now, I
notice his hand -- his sidearm is attached to him. That's for...
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> MCCANN </SPEAKER>
Exactly...
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> O'BRIEN </SPEAKER>
... (UNINTELLIGIBLE)...
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> MCCANN </SPEAKER>
... (UNINTELLIGIBLE) retention, for retention capability. So he goes down
the hallway, and you can see once that's called clear, straight trigger
finger, in case there's any sympathetic muscle tightening, there's no
problem. You'll see another person come right up here, and he'll hold on
this door, because that's not been cleared space yet, again, straight
trigger finger, but ready to shoot if he needs to.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> O'BRIEN </SPEAKER>
Sort of ready but not quite (UNINTELLIGIBLE).
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> MCCANN </SPEAKER>
Absolutely.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> O'BRIEN </SPEAKER>
(UNINTELLIGIBLE).
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> MCCANN </SPEAKER>
Immediately making entry with the thing, and then pying (ph) the room
out, getting angles of vision as they clear it. But look at that, a dark
space from a lighted space. Who knows what's in the recesses?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> O'BRIEN </SPEAKER>
All right. Let's roll that second tape quickly, and we'll show you a
couple more tips from Kelly's perspective. So far, what we're seeing is
pretty much textbook.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> MCCANN </SPEAKER>
Absolutely. (UNINTELLIGIBLE)...
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> O'BRIEN </SPEAKER>
All right. Now, this is a rural setting, but this could be applied to
urban combat, yes.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> MCCANN </SPEAKER>
Very different circumstance. Same thing when you come into a building.
But stop the tape right here...
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> O'BRIEN </SPEAKER>
Oop, we missed it, we missed it...
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> MCCANN </SPEAKER>
... if you would, (UNINTELLIGIBLE) -- It's all right. You can see all
this area...
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> O'BRIEN </SPEAKER>
No, just roll it.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> MCCANN </SPEAKER>
... out here. Just go ahead and roll it. All of that has to be accounted
for as well, not just the space in here. Your back is not covered. Many
angles you've got to watch for. Now, you see right here, he's got a
sidearm, he's calling the team in. All the rear is -- Now, stop the tape.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> O'BRIEN </SPEAKER>
Yes, (UNINTELLIGIBLE).
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> MCCANN </SPEAKER>
Imagine a person that is concealed anywhere in here. I mean, you could
have anyone with a rifle back in these areas here...
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> O'BRIEN </SPEAKER>
Up in this area here, here...
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> MCCANN </SPEAKER>
... in any of these recesses back over here.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> O'BRIEN </SPEAKER>
Oop.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> MCCANN </SPEAKER>
I mean, you know, you're looking at -- he wouldn't have a bomb
(UNINTELLIGIBLE)...
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> O'BRIEN </SPEAKER>
No, he wouldn't have that. But let me ask you this. Also that the garb,
(UNINTELLIGIBLE) there's a cultural issue here. That provides a lot of
cover for weapons if need be, right?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> MCCANN </SPEAKER>
Absolutely. And someones might say, Well, why put their hands on their
head like this? Because, you know, you -- the hands hurt. And I won't be
able to determine what you're doing with your face. Where are your hands
and what do they hold?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> O'BRIEN </SPEAKER>
All right. Let's roll it real quickly and we'll make a few more points,
if we could. A lot of fear in their faces here. You see, by the way, they
all have radios, I notice they have, like, a little headset there. That
allows them to communicate (UNINTELLIGIBLE)...
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> MCCANN </SPEAKER>
Immediate communications, absolutely. You see them having their sectors
of fire. All these areas up in here, you know, could be subjected to
people hiding, et cetera. Now you've got people coming down that have
already been cleared. Look at the fear on the faces. They don't
understand what's going on.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> O'BRIEN </SPEAKER>
And you want to keep them calm, and...
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> MCCANN </SPEAKER>
Very calm, reassure them that this isn't about them.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> O'BRIEN </SPEAKER>
Wow.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> MCCANN </SPEAKER>
Now, here's a little bit more aggressive stance. Exactly. Go ahead and
stop tape...
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> O'BRIEN </SPEAKER>
Stop it right there. Oh, we missed it again.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> MCCANN </SPEAKER>
... if you can. Obviously, that person is doing something that that
soldier didn't appreciate.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> O'BRIEN </SPEAKER>
I would say aggressive is a good word for that...
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> MCCANN </SPEAKER>
Absolutely.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> O'BRIEN </SPEAKER>
... the business end of that M-16. All right, Kelly McCann, thank you for
some insights. And that -- compound that by a city of 5 million, it kind
of boggles the mind and really gives you a sense of what lies head for
U.S. and coalition forces. Thanks very much for your insights.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> MCCANN </SPEAKER>
Pleasure, Miles.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> O'BRIEN </SPEAKER>
Judy.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> WOODRUFF </SPEAKER>
Thanks, Miles and Kelly. I've always wondered what happened -- who covers
the last man or woman in one of those operations, but that's something
for your next conversation.
