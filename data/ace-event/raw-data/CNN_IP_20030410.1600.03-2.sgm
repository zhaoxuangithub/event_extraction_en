Saddam Hussein is Losing Grip on Northern Cities in Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> WOODRUFF </SPEAKER>
Some pictures. Well, Laith Kubba is an Iraqi exile who has family members
in Iraq. Mr. Kubba is a senior fellow at a think tank called the National
Endowment for Democracy. He is also the president of a group of Iraqi
exiles, a group called the Iraq National Group. He joins us now from
London to talk about rebuilding his country. Mr. Kubba, first of all,
your thoughts as you've watched these scenes of Baghdad, the Saddam
Hussein regime falling in the last day?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> LAITH KUBBA, PRESIDENT, IRAQI NATIONAL GROUP </SPEAKER>
It is a huge sigh of relief, because it could have been much worse and
Baghdad could have been a war theater with more destruction to property.
And, obviously, there are four million people who could have suffered
more. So, there is a sigh of relief that it is not worse. But, obviously,
there is a great, great concern about the scenes that you've been showing
on television.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> WOODRUFF </SPEAKER>
Are you talking to family members now in Baghdad and around Iraq? And, if
you are, how concerned are they about the lawlessness?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> KUBBA </SPEAKER>
Well, not in the recent three or four days. There are no phone lines to
Baghdad. In other parts of Iraq, I received with great sadness the
killing of one close colleague, Saeed Abu Naji Abhuey (ph) in Najaf. He
was not killed by former members of the Baath Party or the security of
the army, but by just a local organized group. So those signs to me are
worrying. People are sensing and feeling the lack of authority or the
power vacuum and are testing it. And the more they test, the more I think
they are claiming.

<TURN>
<SPEAKER> WOODRUFF </SPEAKER>
How difficult will it be to sort out who will next hold power in Iraq
after this transition period, however long it is, where the U.S. is in
charge?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> KUBBA </SPEAKER>
Well, one needs to break down this process into various elements. Today,
there should be an authority. And it's very likely that the U.S. and the
British forces are the authority on land. And there ought to be
administration. And this ought to be primarily by Iraqis. But when it
comes to government, I think we really need to map out step by step how
to move from this power vacuum to the day we have elections. We need to
involve the U.N. We need to involve all Iraqi forces in the country,
outside the country. But we need to do it quickly, because every day
passes by with this vacuum, it's going to spell trouble.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> WOODRUFF </SPEAKER>
Well, we know, Mr. Kubba, there are several Iraqi exiles groups competing
for influence. Is one of them going to have an advantage? And,
particularly, I have in mind the Iraqi National Congress that Mr.
Chalabi, who was assisted by U.S. forces in getting back into Iraq?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> KUBBA </SPEAKER>
I think it's one thing to gain fame and access to Washington. It's
totally another to gain legitimacy and functioning grounds inside Iraq.
And I think plans must not be drawn in thin air out in Washington. It
must really be drawn on the ground inside Iraq. And there are 22 million
people there. It's not a void. It's not a vacuum. And I think all plans
must be anchored there in Iraq in its reality.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> WOODRUFF </SPEAKER>
So does one group have an advantage over another now?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> KUBBA </SPEAKER>
There are different groups who have advantage over others in different
parts of the country. Unfortunately, we do not have a national group that
can appeal to Iraqis as Iraqis within a credible voice.This needs to be
constructed, maybe through a conference to be held in Baghdad, where
representatives from provinces all over Iraq need to participate, as well
as political groups. But we do not have a single group, a single
leadership or a single council yet.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> WOODRUFF </SPEAKER>
We're talking with Laith Kubba, who is the president of a group of Iraqi
exiles. The group is called the Iraq National Group. Mr. Kubba, we thank
you so much for talking to us from London.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> KUBBA </SPEAKER>
Thank you.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> WOODRUFF </SPEAKER>
We appreciate it.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> KUBBA </SPEAKER>
Thank you.

<SPEAKER> WOODRUFF </SPEAKER>
Here in Washington, members of the House of Representatives come together
to support America's armed forces. Up next: a live report on that
ceremony and the latest efforts to pass a spending bill to pay for the
war.
