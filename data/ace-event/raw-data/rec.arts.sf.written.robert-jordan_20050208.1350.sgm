<SUBJECT> [TAN] Parole </SUBJECT>

This is just a point of interest, I am not going to jail, and most
certainly not in America - and my interest lies in the American jail
system.

I've browsed around the internet and can't find the information I'm
after.

What's the deal with parole?

If you get out on parole, what happens then, and how long does it last?
(and, specifically, who takes you home once you get out of jail, or do
you just get turfed out and expected to check in with your parole
officer the next day?).

And, again fairly specifically (and I realise this is state specific,
but I'm kinda looking for a general answer here): if an eighteen year
old gets caught selling marijuana to 12-14 year olds, and gets put away
for, say, three years, is this the sort of deal where he's likely to
get parole, or just do the time and leave again?

Getting out on parole is usually a reward for good behavior while
serving time. So you're basically free, with the expectation that you
will not leave the state (assuming you've been jailed by the state
gov't) and you have to check in with your parole officer on a regular
basis (I think they give you a schedule). I *believe* you are also
expected to get a job, housing, etc. and report this also. In some
cases you may be referred to a specific 'halfway' house for
reintroduction into society, and provided with a simple job. As for how
long it lasts, I would say that it lasts for the rest of your sentence,
but I'm not sure about that. Also, you can call someone to come pick
you up when you leave, or call a taxi I guess.

Not just state-specific, judge(jury)-specific and case-specific. For
some reason, I can't recall if selling drugs to minors qualifies as a
jury trial or what. But these decisions are entirely up to the
judge/jury, and the decision is usually made in regard to the character
of the defendant.

This is all based on my experience in New York.

You have to provide a planned residence when you're considered for
parole, usually a relative or program of some kind. It lasts as long
as the rest of your sentence lasts. You can go back to prison for
violating the conditions of your parole, for a period of time up until
your sentence runs out. Parole is not a right and its granting is
discretionary.

    -Actually, it's not quite a reward for good behavior. When you have served at
    -least your minimum sentence, the parole board gives you a hearing to decide
    -whether you are a good risk to send back into society.

Indeed, New York's statute says, "Discretionary release on parole
shall not be granted merely as a reward for good conduct or efficient
performance of duties while confined but after considering if there is
a reasonable probability that, if such inmate is released, he will
live and remain at liberty without violating the law, and that his
release is not incompatible with the welfare of society and will not
so deprecate the seriousness of his crime as to undermine respect for
law." N.Y. Executive Law 259-i(2)(c)(A).

(Instead, there are ways of getting your parole eligibility date moved
up for good behavior, or of creating strong presumptions in favor of
parole release.)

One of the factors for the standard Kate mentioned is whether the
inmate has rehabilitated himself. Rehabilitation is one of the major
goals of prison.
