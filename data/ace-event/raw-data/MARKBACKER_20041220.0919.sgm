While it was entertaining, that's not why I'm posting about it. I
don't normally post about pro football, but what I saw deserved a
ranting or two, and I suspect it's going to get many more in the days
and weeks to come.

With 4:41 left in the fourth quarter and the Packers down by 11,
Favre hit Robert Ferguson with a 31 yard strike near the left hash
marks. Coming from the other direction, Jacksonville DB Donovin Darius
unloaded chin high on Ferguson with a vicious clothesline. Remarkably,
Ferguson held on to the ball, despite being disjoined from his helmet on
the hit. After many minutes lying motionless on the field, Ferguson was
finally removed via stretcher, giving a thumbs up to the crowd on the
way out.

The Packers went on to lose the game, but that's not the story here.

This was not one of the staged stiff-armed clotheslines you see in
professional wrestling broadcasts. This was a vicious, arm cocked and
swinging clothesline that literally could have torn Ferguson's head off
of his body.

The play was immediately flagged, and moments later it was announced
that Darius had been ejected, much to the crowd's delight.

One sidenote here is that, despite their rabid fandom and the
situation, not one thing was thrown at the offending player as he left
the field. It would have been easy to bathe him in beer or snowballs or
batteries as he left, but the Packer fans are classier than that. To a
person, they acted with class, using their voices and not projectiles to
express their displeasure.

This was the most vicious and blatantly dirty play I have seen in the
NFL since Jim McMahon was body slammed to the ground in the mid 80's
about five seconds after he had released a pass. And Jaguars coach Jack
Del Rio and Darius had the nerve to vociferously argue with officials
about Darius' ejection from the game.

I don't care what anyone says about "you can't judge intent." Darius'
intent was to dismember, injure or even kill Ferguson. The more I saw
the replay, the sicker it made me feel.

The league must take action, and it must be swift and sure. I'm
talking about a four game suspension that included the playoffs if
necessary.

In this day and age of bigger, stronger and faster players, injuries
are going to happen accidentally all of the time. There is simply no
room for the kind of play that resulted in Ferguson's injury. Paul
Tagliabue must give word to all of his employees that actions like this
will not be tolerated.

Maybe that will tell the Jaguars, Darius and players like him that
this kind of head-hunting will not be tolerated in the NFL.

If not, I fully expect the Packers and many other teams to handle
this matter "on the field" with Darius being the target of similar
attacks by tight ends and offensive lineman.
