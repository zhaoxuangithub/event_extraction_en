An apparent friendly fire incident in northern Iraq is taking more of a
toll on Kurdish leaders than we knew at first. Eighteen people are now
reported dead. And there are late reports that the 45 wounded include the
brother and a son of a Kurdish political leader. Julian Manyon of ITN has
more from Northern Iraq.

It is another friendly fire disaster. This morning, an American bomb
destroyed a convoy carrying high officials of the Kurdish Peshmerga
forces, which have been fighting alongside the Americans on the northern
front. At least 17 Kurdish commanders and their guards were killed, along
with an interpreter working for the BBC. More than 40 were injured. The
military chief of the Kurdish KDP, the brother of their leader, Massud
Barzani (ph), was gravely hurt. (on camera): Trying to organize a
northern front with just a few hundred U.S. Special Forces troops and the
poorly armed Kurdish Peshmerga guerrillas was always going to be a
high-risk exercise. The idea was to open the way with heavy sustained
American bombing of Iraqi positions. But today, it all went disastrously
wrong. (voice-over): Even as we filmed the wreckage, U.S. jets were still
dropping their bombs nearby. Giant explosions erupted down the road.
Earlier, we had joined another convoy of U.S. Special Forces troops and
Kurdish fighters as they tried to move south through country abandoned by
the Iraqi army. At first, all was calm. American troops controlled the
operation from a rooftop. Then, as the Kurds advanced again, the Iraqis
opened up. (on camera): Now we're hearing the boom of Iraqi guns as they
fire towards our positions. All morning, the Kurds have been trying to
advance, and that was the shell going off. (voice-over): The Iraqi
gunners rapidly found our range, and we took refuge in an abandoned farm
house.

We finally managed to get out by car. Here in the north, Iraqi tanks and
guns are still firing, and the American effort is looking a little
ragged. Julian Manyon, ITV News, on the northern front.
