<SPEAKER> BLITZER </SPEAKER>
Welcome back to LATE EDITION. We return now to my interview earlier today
with the United States defense secretary, Donald Rumsfeld.
</TURN>
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> BLITZER </SPEAKER>
I know during the war, before the war, you were very concerned about the
position of the Syrian government, cooperating with Iraqis, having an
open border, if you will. Has the situation improved, especially in the
aftermath now of the secretary of state's meeting with Bashar al-Asad?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> RUMSFELD </SPEAKER>
Well, I guess time will tell. I talked to Secretary Powell this morning
on the phone a bit, and it's not, I think you need to let the dust settle
on that. He's, in my judgment, had a visit that was worth doing, and the
president asked him to do it, and it was the right thing to do. We'll see
what progress comes. You know, words are one thing, actions are another.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> BLITZER </SPEAKER>
But right now you're open-minded as far as Syria on whether they will
crack down on terrorism, take some of the other steps that you want them
to take?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> RUMSFELD </SPEAKER>
I know what they've been doing, and it's been unhelpful. I know that
Secretary Powell was just there and advised them that it was unhelpful,
and gave them some pointers and some suggestions for the future. In my
view, they were making some unwise decisions previously. What they'll do
after this visit remains to be seen.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> BLITZER </SPEAKER>
The secretary of state has written you a letter expressing, apparently,
some concern about the length that the prisoners are going to be
spending, those detained at the U.S. Naval base at Guantanamo Bay in
Cuba, about 600 or so of them. Is there any movement in trying to
determine the fate of these individuals?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> RUMSFELD </SPEAKER>
I don't think that's quite accurate as to what he wrote me about.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> BLITZER </SPEAKER>
All right, tell me what...
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> RUMSFELD </SPEAKER>
I think what he wrote me about was the fact that the inter-agency
process, where we have all these FBI and Department of Justice and CIA
and DIA, and what have you, involved in interrogating these detainees, it
takes time to find out what intelligence they have. It also takes time to
figure out what law enforcement process might be appropriate, and what
Colin and I have been concerned about, both of us, is that it's taking so
long. There are a number of countries, and the Department of State has
the responsibility of dealing with those countries, that have foreign
nationals in Gitmo, in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, being detained, and those
countries, understandably, would like to know when they could have those
people.So the inter-agency process takes a great deal of time. Colin and
I are trying to speed up that process, and that's what that's all about.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> BLITZER </SPEAKER>
Let me just, a couple of nuggets to sort of wrap up before I let you go.
Victory parades for the troops. I remember covering General Schwarzkopf,
the parades in Washington and New York after the first Gulf War. Do you
want the troops to be honored in that way when they come back, to have
parades in New York, Washington, elsewhere?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> RUMSFELD </SPEAKER>
There's no question but that the troops, the young men and women, did
such a superb job that there has to be a way to honor them, and there
will be. And General Franks and his team have done just a superb job for
our country and for the world, and indeed for the Iraqi people, who have
been liberated. What's the best way to do that? In the case of 1991, the
task was to go in and get them out of Kuwait, and they did it, and they
were properly greeted coming back to the United States. In this instance,
it was a very different task. It was to remove that regime, and it's part
of a global war on terrorism that is not over. We still have to face the
problem of a number of global terrorist networks and terrorist states
that exist, that work with those global networks. And on the one hand we
will, in fact, find a way to honor the courage and dedication and talent
of these young men and women, and we'll do it well. Whether it will be
modeled off the 1991 thing, I don't know. I kind of doubt it, because
it's such a different circumstance. Certainly, our war plan was not
modeled off of 1991.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> BLITZER </SPEAKER>
One final question on North Korea. If the North Koreans pursue their
nuclear weapons ambitions...
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> RUMSFELD </SPEAKER>
Yes.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> BLITZER </SPEAKER>
... a preemptive strike, is that something that is out there?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> RUMSFELD </SPEAKER>
I'm not one who speculates about things like that. I know that back in
the 1990s, in the Clinton administration, Secretary Perry called in the
former secretaries of defense, and we had a discussion, and they clearly
had teed up a military option that they were considering, and they then
at a certain moment were able to do some things that persuaded them that
that was not appropriate. But those are very serious issues, and I leave
them for the president.
