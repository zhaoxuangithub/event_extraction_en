Stephen of IRA-CAM is experiencing Sitemeter envy over all those
succesful political blogs. Understandable! After all, my biggest surge
in hits came from a link from, well, a political blog. However, I'd
rather not worry -- instead, I'd like to think of our situation as akin
to Instapundit , or Andrew Sullivan , or Daily Kos in, say, the summer
of 2001. Blogs didn't get huge until people saw them updated
continuously on September 11th, and during the primaries, and later on
during the conventions. In politics, there's a definite four-year cycle,
and any new medium can find its voice and carve out an audience in that
time. Financial markets aren't so kind.

In short, we need a crash, and we need to blog it.

Those poliblog hits come at a cost. My half-hearted trolling dragged
back some hate to my site. No wonder why they turn off the comments.

I can understand that. When you're blogging about stocks, it's
possible -- though a little difficult -- to say "Okay, you're right, I'm
wrong. So I'm going to sell what I had, and sell it short!" And everyone
can be reasonably happy. But a political blog is usually built around a
certain ideology, and no matter how compelling you are, you probably
won't change anyone's stated opinions (Instant Counterpoint: Check
Little Green Footballs now, and compare that to the September 11th
archive).
