TOKYO (AP)

Toyota Motor Corp. said Tuesday it will promote Akio Toyoda, a
grandson of the company's founder who is widely viewed as a candidate
to some day head Japan's largest automaker.

Managing director Toyoda, 46, grandson of Kiichiro Toyoda and the
eldest son of Toyota honorary chairman Shoichiro Toyoda, will become
one of 14 senior managing directors under a streamlined management
system set to be introduced after a shareholders' meeting in June,
the company said in a statement.

Toyoda, who joined Toyota, based in Toyota city, central Japan, in
1984, spearheaded the automaker's Internet and telematics business  _
 a technology that puts wireless communications into vehicles.
Considered a candidate for future Toyota president, Toyoda oversees
its China business, a critical market for the automaker.

Toyoda has been on the star track for years. When he joined the board
in 2000, he was its youngest member.

Under a reform led by President Fujio Cho, the membership of Toyota's
board of directors will be slashed to 27 from 58. Executive vice
presidents will be reduced to seven from nine.

The new system is designed to ``speed up decision-making and
operations,'' Toyota spokesman Shigeru Hayakawa said.

Toyota's top posts held by Cho and Chairman Hiroshi Okuda remain
unchanged.

Kiichiro Toyoda founded the automaker in 1937, transforming the loom
manufacturer started by his father into an automaker.
