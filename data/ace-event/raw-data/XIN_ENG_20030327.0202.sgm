The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) presented its
"Outstanding Alumni Award" to five alumni here Thursday to pay
tribute to their remarkable professional achievements and significant
contributions to their alma mater and the community.

Professor John Lee Hak-shan at the Department of Mechanical
Engineering of McGill University of Canada, Rebecca Lee Lok-sze,

Kwong-wai, President &amp; Managing Director of Solomon Systech
Limited, Liu Sing-cheong, Founder and Managing Director of Pearl

Renowned as the world's first woman explorer who has reached the

contributions toward polar exploration over the past 20 years.

In 1997, she successfully founded the China Polar Museum Foundation
with a view to consolidating scientific research findings about polar

Launched in 1996, the biennial alumni selection is jointly organized
by PolyU and the Federation of PolyU Alumni Associations for the
fourth time, so as to accord public recognition to outstanding
