The people of Tikrit are saying Saddam's family left that city three days
ago, well before the Americans arrived. Saddam's clan is said to have
left for a small village in the desert. 12:19 p.m.: CNN's Ryan Chilcote
reports the 101st Airborne 2nd Brigade finds 11 of what an Army general
describes as chem-bio labs buried to avoid detection near Karbala, each
of the structures 20-by- 20 feet. And the military also found over 1,000
pounds of documents buried at the site. U.S. inspections will continue
there.

Well, Baghdad is a city where drinking water and working telephones are
hot commodities. Now, regular cell phones rarely work these days in the
city, we're told, but satellite phones are another story entirely. CNN's
Rula Amin reports from the Iraqi capital.

They wait for hours to find a journalist and they plead with us to borrow
our mobile satellite phones. They need to send a message to their
families abroad just to tell them, "We are alive," says this woman. Here,
they wait outside a restaurant where journalists hang out. And they are
desperate. "Only for one minute," says this mother. She wants to call her
pregnant daughter Saba (ph) in Sweden to see if she has delivered. "It's
not good for her to worry about us," she says. Across the fence, a
21-year-old U.S. Marine named Jason Cook (ph) is after the same phones.
He wants to call his mom in Houston. A "New York Times" reporter lends
Cook his mobile sat phone.

I love you too, mom. Hey, old man. I'm in the middle of Baghdad, just
patrolling up and down the streets.

<SPEAKER> AMIN </SPEAKER>
Cook hasn't spoken to his family since Super Bowl Sunday, January 26. On
this one sidewalk in Baghdad, they were all doing the most natural thing
during war, trying to reach their loved ones.

My mother, brother and sister.

His mother told him to keep his head down.

<SPEAKER> UNIDENTIFIED MALE </SPEAKER>
She didn't believe I was really talking to her.

<SPEAKER> AMIN </SPEAKER>
We do our share. And the first to call is the mother. Saba hasn't
delivered yet. Nevertheless, the mother is happy. Everyone wanted to
call. We couldn't accommodate everybody. So, on small notes, they wrote
the phone numbers we didn't get to dial, hoping we'd deliver on our
promise that we'd call on their behalf. Rula Amin, CNN, Baghdad.

<SPEAKER> WOODRUFF </SPEAKER>
Makes you wish they had enough satellite phones to go around for
everybody. Thanks, Rula. Up next: the commander-in-chief's political
future. Now that the war is winding down, is his support among Democrats
looking up?
