9. Elections Did you vote in the recent US Presidential election?
What did you think of the two candidates, George Bush and John Kerry?
What about the Vice Presidential candidates, Dick Cheney and John
Edwards?  What issues were most important to you in deciding who to
vote for?  If you didn't vote, why not?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Obo </SPEAKER>
Hello, my my name is Obo in Ithaca, New York
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ted </SPEAKER>
Hi, my na- -- Hey, my name is Ted and I'm in Jacksonville, Florida.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Obo </SPEAKER>
Oh, nice, sounds like it's a lot warmer down there.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ted </SPEAKER>
Oh yeah, sun's shining, it's a beautiful day.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Obo </SPEAKER>
Yeah, I guess the elections, ah -- basically, who did you vote for, and
the vice presidential candidates, and why, and I'll be honest with you
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ted </SPEAKER>
Yeah, go ahead.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Obo </SPEAKER>
I didn't vote for either of those.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ted </SPEAKER>
Oh okay.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Obo </SPEAKER>
I did vote, but I I don't vote for the main party
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ted </SPEAKER>
Uh-huh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Obo </SPEAKER>
ever, I usually try to stay out of the main party, because I think,
and this last election showed that both are very brutal.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ted </SPEAKER>
It was
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Obo </SPEAKER>
Um, yeah I think that the, uh
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ted </SPEAKER>
election.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Obo </SPEAKER>
Oh, I'm sorry.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ted </SPEAKER>
It was a very brutal election.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Obo </SPEAKER>
Yeah, yeah, it's, yeah, you're absolutely, yeah, and I'm sorry, I
mean, if you want to add anything I'm sorry.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ted </SPEAKER>
No no, go ahead, go ahead.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Obo </SPEAKER>
And, ah -- It's, it's just that -- Like, I I just, I think that the last
fifty years, the government has been mes- messed up by both these
parties, honestly.  Even maybe before that.  So, I, I usually do third
party -- um, and the way it was working this year was that the Democrats
really pushed to get Ralph Nader off the ballot
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ted </SPEAKER>
Yeah.  Yeah they did.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Obo </SPEAKER>
in every state, and um -- I mean, the Republicans sort of tried to play
like they were helping him out, but they knew they they didn't really
have to because they knew the Democrats were already doing more damage
to keep him off the ballot and they were successful, and for a
progressive party that was very brutal.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ted </SPEAKER>
Mhm, it was.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Obo </SPEAKER>
And I wasn't really impressed by either of the two vice presidential
candidates, I know Dick Cheney seems to be running the show
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ted </SPEAKER>
You know?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Obo </SPEAKER>
and, ah -- I mean, and, and a lot of it has to do -- and then, I just
didn't know much, John Edwards seemed nice, but he just, you know, he
was just, he just got elected to the Senate,  and,  I wasn't really
familiar too much with hi- I mean, I think it's great that he got into
the vice presidential role, but -- again, it's the whole parties that
I'm really not really I don't like their policies.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ted </SPEAKER>
Well, you kind of hit on some of my sentiments, um, I'm a fifty-year-
old black male,  and this was my first election that I participated
in.  And the reason was was that, ah, I'm retired Air Force -- and
before, ah, because I was in the military -- ah, didn't didn't really
think that my vote, um, counted one way or the other, that's that was
my thinking.  You know, I had a role to fulfill and regardless of how
I voted, uh, I was going to have to fulfill that role.  Um,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Obo </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ted </SPEAKER>
the, the situation, though, now that I'm out and, in the civilian
sector,  um,  I find that the economics as far as home -- is what I'm
most concerned with.  And because of the economic situation, I don't
think that's being addressed.  Yes, I feel very, very bad in regards
to the, ah, nine-eleven tragedy and terrorism and this kind of stuff
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Obo </SPEAKER>
Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ted </SPEAKER>
um, but I think so much attention is being paid to that -- that -- as you
mentioned, over the past fifty years, the two parties that run the
country -- um, have definitely taken a, um -- streamlined approach to
whatever their agenda may be and not the will of the people.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Obo </SPEAKER>
You said it very well.  I totally, you coul- I couldn't have said it
better.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ted </SPEAKER>
Now it's uh -- and as time goes on, you know, like, ah, what are we,
you know, headed for, what are we faced with?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Obo </SPEAKER>
I I
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ted </SPEAKER>
I mean, if we don't start looking inward and start taking care of
things at home -- uh, right now, yeah, we are the biggest power in the
world.  I heard a commentary by Rush Limbaugh, ah, the other day, and
the comment was made was that there always is going to be a big dog on
the street.  And right now I'm proud to be, ah, you know, behind the
big dog, meaning the United States.  If i- if if -- the United States is
not the big dog,  some power in the world is going to step up and be
just that.  We got so many crises and tension uh what do you -- hot
spots in the world,  that, uh,  instead of getting better, it seems to
be growing.  We got, uh, what is it, Iran?  Uh, right behind Iraq
there.  And then North Korea, which is, you know, always volatile.
Uh, you know, those situations are not getting any better, you know?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Obo </SPEAKER>
You're absolutely right, yes.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ted </SPEAKER>
And as far as -- You know, I mean, what are we going to do?  We can- we
cannot -- police the whole world.  We, we truly cannot.
