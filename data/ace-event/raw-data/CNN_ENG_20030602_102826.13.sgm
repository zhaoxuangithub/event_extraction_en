five motions are being heard today in the case of lee boyd malvo, the
teenage sniper suspect. one for a change of venue. defense attorneys
argue that there has been so much pretrial publicity, including an
alleged confession from malvo, that this has tainted the jury pool.
their more intriguing argument is that one of the charges against
malvo is under virginia's anti-terrorism statute and they argue that
every resident of fairfax county is potentially a member of the
victim's class. and therefore, disqualified from serving as a juror.
the prosecutor will argue against this motion. he calls it factually
pro pos truss. if history is any guide, this motion will have a tough
time. no case has been moved out of fairfax county since 1974. there
also is a motion to dismiss this case. defense attorneys argue that an
individual cannot be charged under federal law and then state law for
the same act. prosecutors again will argue against the motion. three
other motions as well. one of those for a handwriting expert, the
other motions relate to getting background information relating to
ballistics testing and dna testing. malvo on trial here in fairfax
county for the murder of linda franklin, the fbi analyst who was
gunned down in a home depot parking lot. that's just one of the ten
sniper shootings here in the greater washington area. today's motions
hearing just part of the preliminary skirmishing. the actual trial
will be getting under way this fall. jeanne meserve, cnn, fairfax
county, virginia.
