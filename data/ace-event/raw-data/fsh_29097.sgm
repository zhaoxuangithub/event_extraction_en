<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Suzanne </SPEAKER>
Hi, I'm Suzanne from Philadelphia.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sara </SPEAKER>
Hi, this is Sara, from California.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Suzanne </SPEAKER>
Hi.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sara </SPEAKER>
Hey.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Suzanne </SPEAKER>
So who do you think should run?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sara </SPEAKER>
uh -- I don't know. I was going to say, that's quite the topic.  um -- I
haven't thought about it much.  I know my husband said he thinks -- that
uh -- Colin Powell should -- but I don't think he will.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Suzanne </SPEAKER>
I I don't he think will either, because he turned it down in two
thousand and four.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sara </SPEAKER>
Right, and
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Suzanne </SPEAKER>
Sorry, two thousand and -- two thousand.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sara </SPEAKER>
Two thousand, yeah, the one before that.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Suzanne </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sara </SPEAKER>
Yeah.  uh -- I'm not very fond of Hillary Clinton, so I -- I don't think
I'd go for her, but -- but uh what do you think?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Suzanne </SPEAKER>
um -- I am reluctant to see another Bush brother on the ticket for the
Republicans
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sara </SPEAKER>
Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Suzanne </SPEAKER>
but I think that putting Jeb Bush would make h- -- the Republican ticket
easier to defeat.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sara </SPEAKER>
Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Suzanne </SPEAKER>
um -- I really don't think that Hillary Clinton -- would be -- a good choice
for the Democrats.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sara </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Suzanne </SPEAKER>
um I don't think Barak Obama would be a very good choice for the
Democrats.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sara </SPEAKER>
Uh-huh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Suzanne </SPEAKER>
Just because he's -- he's really young, and he's going to be starting
off his career.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sara </SPEAKER>
Uh-huh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Suzanne </SPEAKER>
um I would almost like to see John Edwards on the ticket again.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sara </SPEAKER>
Uh-huh. Yeah.  uh Yeah. Did they ever do that one? That's n- the-
that's happened before, hasn't it, where someone who -- who was
defeated ran again?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Suzanne </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sara </SPEAKER>
They don't do it very often, probably just because they figure if he
lost once, he'll
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Suzanne </SPEAKER>
Well I I think he's a really good candidate, and four more years could
really help him develop his um -- could help him develop -- hi- his
voting record especially.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sara </SPEAKER>
Right.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Suzanne </SPEAKER>
And I think that would help the Democratic ticket a lot.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sara </SPEAKER>
Right, because that's something he got -- kind of -- uh -- got brought up a
lot.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Suzanne </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sara </SPEAKER>
Hm. Well, they -- let's see.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Suzanne </SPEAKER>
I mean, I'd like to s- -- I'd like to see the Greens run David Cobb
again.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sara </SPEAKER>
Uh-huh.  uh See, hav- I haven't paid much attention to them, I -- I
kind of looked at the -- the other listed candidates -- but I figure -- they
d- -- they d- none of them had enough support to get close, so
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Suzanne </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sara </SPEAKER>
um -- trying to think who else -- Arnold Schwarzenegger I don't think --
well he's not qualified anyway, but
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Suzanne </SPEAKER>
Well, they might change something, you know, between now and then.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sara </SPEAKER>
I've heard people say that would take a -- I I don't think they will.
uh That takes a Constitutional amendment. That's pretty hard to -- to
get through.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Suzanne </SPEAKER>
Well, I mean, you live in California. How is he doing -- in your state?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sara </SPEAKER>
Oh, I think he's done all right, um -- I I -- He's a he's a moderate
Republican, you know, he's not
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Suzanne </SPEAKER>
Right.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sara </SPEAKER>
he's not uh -- hard core Republican, so he works pretty well with -- since
this is this is mostly a Democratic State.  He does pretty well.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Suzanne </SPEAKER>
um -- They've been talking about getting the Canadian-born governor of
I think Minnesota
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sara </SPEAKER>
Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Suzanne </SPEAKER>
to run as well. um
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sara </SPEAKER>
Hm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Suzanne </SPEAKER>
It'd be the first woman running.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sara </SPEAKER>
Right.  Have they never had a woman run before? I know they've
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Suzanne </SPEAKER>
Well, Geraldine Ferraro -- well the first woman for a major party.
Geraldine Ferraro ran
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sara </SPEAKER>
Uh-huh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Suzanne </SPEAKER>
as Vice President -- for the Democrats, I believe
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sara </SPEAKER>
Uh-huh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Suzanne </SPEAKER>
um -- in the eighties.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sara </SPEAKER>
Right.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Suzanne </SPEAKER>
But they've never had a woman as a major candidate
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sara </SPEAKER>
Uh-huh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Suzanne </SPEAKER>
for President.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sara </SPEAKER>
Right.  Yeah. It's got to happen at some point.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Suzanne </SPEAKER>
Right. Because Elizabeth Dole didn't make it too well.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sara </SPEAKER>
Right.  Yeah, she was she was going to be the -- was she going to be the
Vice President
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Suzanne </SPEAKER>
I think she was g- actually going for President herself.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sara </SPEAKER>
candidate?  She was actually going for President?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Suzanne </SPEAKER>
I'd like to see her come back. um I think she's fantastic.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sara </SPEAKER>
Uh-huh.  Yeah, I
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Suzanne </SPEAKER>
And she's she's not too hard-core Republican.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sara </SPEAKER>
Right.  Yeah. I don't know. This -- This uh -- last election being just
over, I hadn't really started thinking much about the next one.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Suzanne </SPEAKER>
Right.  Do you think any of the s- any other state governors have a
really good chance?  uh I'm
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sara </SPEAKER>
You know, I I mean obviously, if Schwarzenegger could run, he's got
the name recognition, but I would be really surprised -- both to see him
run and to see him win, but then again -- I was a little bit surprised
when he won California, so
