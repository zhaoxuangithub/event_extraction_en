LONDON, April 1 (AFP)

British Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown on Tuesday named the
current head of the country's energy regulator as the new chairman of
finance watchdog the Financial Services Authority (FSA).

Former senior banker Callum McCarthy begins what is one of the most
important jobs in London's financial world in September, when
incumbent Howard Davies steps down.

Davies is leaving to become chairman of the London School of
Economics, one of the best-known parts of the University of London.

Brown said McCarthy would bring to the FSA "an unrivalled combination
of experience of the public sector, experience as a senior
practitioner in the financial services industry, and chairman of a
highly successful regulator."

McCarthy currently heads the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets,
or Ofgem, which regulates Britain's privatised energy industry.

As well as previously holding senior positions at Barclays Bank, BZW
and Kleinwort Benson, McCarthy was formerly a top civil servant at
the Department of Trade and Industry.

Under Davies's watch, the FSA became Britain's sole regulatory body
for financial services in November 2001, taking on the various
functions of nine separate agencies.
