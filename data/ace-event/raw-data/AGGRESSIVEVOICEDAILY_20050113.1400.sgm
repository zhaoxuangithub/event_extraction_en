In a horribly deceitful manner, the Brady Campaign has released
"report cards" for every state on their gun laws that supposedly shield
children from gun violence. Thirty-one states received either a "D" or
an "F" from the anti-gun group. I've got all the goods in a new article
I wrote for GunControlPolicy.com . Not surprisingly my home state of
Florida received a "D+" for reasons that are just plain laughable and of
course have nothing to do with kids.
