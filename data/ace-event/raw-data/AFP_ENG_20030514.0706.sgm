PARIS, May 14 (AFP)

Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom on Wednesday stressed Qatar's
role in the Middle East peace process during talks with his Qatari
counterpart Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem bin Jabr al-Thani in Paris.

Shalom told a joint press conference that the tiny Gulf state's
strong relationship with the recently appointed Palestinian prime
minister, Mahmud Abbas, could be a boost for peace.

"We discussed the Middle East peace process. Over an hour of talks,
we asserted the will of both parties (Israel and the Arab world) to
do everything to return to the negotiating table," Shalom said.

"Qatar is a very important country on this issue. I know the special
relationship that the Qatari foreign minister has with Abu Mazen," he
said, using Abbas's alternative name.

The meeting was Shalom's first encounter with an Arab counterpart
since he took office as Israel's foreign minister on February 27.

Qatar has economic links with Israel without maintaining diplomatic
relations, in the face of criticism from other Arab countries.

Afterwards Shalom was to fly on to London for talks with British
Prime Minister Tony Blair and Foreign Secretary Jack Straw.
