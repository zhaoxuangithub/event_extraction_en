LISBON, Portugal (AP)

The U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Europe and Eurasia said
Tuesday that the U.S. government won't be involved in choosing
subcontractors for American companies named to help rebuild Iraq.

``The way it works is that there have been an initial set of
contracts let to US companies, since it's U.S. money. Those companies
can subcontract to any company they want,'' Elizabeth Jones said.

She made the statements after a meeting with the speaker of the
Portuguese parliament, Joao Mota Amaral.

``The U.S. government has done what it is going to do: it has opened
up the process to international companies. We can't direct
commerce,'' Jones said. ``Once it's a commercial proposition, then
international bidding processes come into effect.''

Jones met with Defense Minister Paulo Portas on Tuesday and will meet
Foreign Minister Antonio Martins da Cruz before leaving Portugal
Wednesday.

About 50 Portuguese companies - mostly in the construction sector  _ 
are applying for subcontracts to help rebuild Iraq, Portuguese media
reported. Many are hoping to reap benefits from Portuguese government
support of the U.S.-led war to oust Saddam Hussein.

Also, Portugal hosted a last ditch pre-war summit in the Azores
islands for leaders of the United States, Britain and Spain.
