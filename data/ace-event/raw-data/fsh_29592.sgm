10. Death of Arafat (2) PLO leader PLO leader Yasser Arafat died in a
Paris hospital last week, after a lot of controversy surrounding his
illness and death.  What do you think caused his illness, and could it
have been something malicious (like poisoning)?  What do you think of
Israel's policies surrounding Arafat's illness and death?  Should
President Bush or a senior US official have attended Arafat's funeral?
Should Israel have let Arafat be buried in Jerusalem?

</TURN>
<TURN>

</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mike </SPEAKER>
So- so what do you think?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Well, I'm think-
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mike </SPEAKER>
How about you start.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Yeah, okay, um, ((lot of question)) -- and, um,  I- I don't think it was
poisoning, even though I haven't read -- a lot of articles about it. I
think-
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mike </SPEAKER>
He- he was old. I mean-
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Y- he was old, yeah.  And- -- and that- I- I didn't realize he wasn't
allowed to be buried in Jerusalem, which-
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mike </SPEAKER>
Yeah, but a lot of that has to do with things that he's done.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mike </SPEAKER>
He's- I mean, like, you know, let's- i- -- for- for all he did in his
later years, eh, Yasser Arafat was responsible for -- a good chunk of
al- you know, a lot of -- Israeli dying -- i- you know.  He basically, eh,
i- I'm completely torn on the whole thing. I mean, on one hand -- I
think it was kind of wrong that -- that -- you know, the ~UN just kind of
went in and said, hey, you know, guess what?  You know, we're- we're
you know, this is Israel now, state of Israel.  And basically what
they did was they carved up the region and- -- without any regard to,
you know, tribal -- animosity really, is really what it boils down to,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mike </SPEAKER>
um.  You know, then it th- it was there,  he had to try to maintain
the status quo -- but they bred -- people like Yasser Arafat, I mean,  if
it -- if it wasn't for the stupidity of the United Nations,  people like
Yasser Yara- Arafat w- probably would've never even gotten off the
ground,  you know.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
How how did the United Nations, uh,  Arafat in power, or help?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mike </SPEAKER>
Well, in other words eh, in other -- when -- after World War Two when they
when -- basically the state of Israel was formed
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mike </SPEAKER>
in f- uh, nineteen forty eight, I think it was.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mike </SPEAKER>
Um,  you know, you- e- -- granted, you know, there were there were
Jewish people already living there,  but -- all the Jewish people
started going there and they j- basically just- you know, they just
took over.  And- and
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mike </SPEAKER>
in in a region where,  uh, you know,  y- you know, we live in America.
It's like coup- you know, f- our country's a couple hundred years old,
we got a couple of gripes going back to, you know, what, seventeen
seventy six,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mike </SPEAKER>
there it goes,  you know, thous- it's like the Hatfields and the
McCoys. They're fi- they don't even know why they're fighting anymore.
They just they hate each other -- and they're always going to hate each
other -- and it doesn't matter who started it,  but -- i- you know,
somebody eh, th- somebody's in always intent on winning.  And it's and
it's it's you know,  a war of attrition. Nobody wins. It's either,
you know,  you may kill me, but I'm going to kill all of you before-
y- you know what I mean? It's just i- i- it's stupid. The whole
thing's stupid. And a guy like Yasser Arafat,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Yeah.  Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mike </SPEAKER>
he was a terrorist.  In in the sixties -- in the mid sixties an- and and
a- you know, on into- -- you know, through the mid eighties -- the guy was
a terrorist.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
So, let us let us not forget that when Israel was -- formed -- and they
were,  um,  the -- the Israelis for not feeling -- like they had a
legitimate -- right -- some of the land or that -- land wasn't, um,
rightfully theirs. There were -- two very strong -- militant groups that
were Israeli and they -- committed a lot of terrorist acts,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mike </SPEAKER>
Oh, the yeah, the Zionists. Abso- absolutely.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
much -- Yeah.  So, I mean, i- -- you know,  uh, how we consider -- Arafat a
terrorist,  we also should consider that -- could've been, in some ways,
a reaction to some of the terrorism that was -- initially -- committed by
the Israelis.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mike </SPEAKER>
Absolutely. I'm not believe me, I'm not I'm not excusing -- anybody -- but
for the purpose I I mean, the way I see it is you know, I guess for
the purposes of the conversation th- -- that they want to hear,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mike </SPEAKER>
y- you got to kind of have to put that as y- -- i- it's kind of like -- do
if that's the case, do two wrongs really make a right?  You know what
I mean?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
But if Arafat hadn't been I don't know if he's -- directly -- been linked
to Hamas' acts,  uh,  but he was put in a -- pretty -- sticky situation
having to negotiate -- the militants of -- Palestine -- the international
leaders -- and if it if Hara- Arafat hadn't -- somehow appeased -- the
Hamas groups or the Palestinian militants,  then -- he would've been
kicked out,  overthrown -- by- -- by the Palestinians.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mike </SPEAKER>
Oh, forget about kicked out or overthrown, he would've been killed.
That's-that's how it works over there.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Yeah. Yeah.  Exactly.  Well, it it's not really Arafat -- as an
individual, I think it's just -- whatever leader -- is -- placed in the
position of-
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mike </SPEAKER>
He was he was basically -- I mean, I've read I've read articles an- and-
and- and -- stories that basically have linked him to the to the to the
Munich -- massacre -- th- you know, the Munich Olympic massacre th- the
Is- the Israeli team. It- -- the the problem is -- what he did -- back way
back when
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Uh-huh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mike </SPEAKER>
will -- f- forever tarnish anything that he did -- in his later years.
Like like you said, bringing the groups together but the reason that
he was able to bring them together is because he was once one of them.
