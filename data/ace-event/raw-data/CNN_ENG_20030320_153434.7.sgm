back to something kelly wallace said. she was talking about the
somewhat blase attitude of israelis. we were lacking at the front page
of the jerusalem post the other day. the big banner headline that day
big and bold, was president bush issues ultimatum. on the side column,
as an afterthought, sit tense told to carry gas masks wherever they
go. it gives you a sense of, perhaps what 50 years of tension and war
will do to your mentality. but it does also say that the israelis are
a bit more blase, if that's a fair word for it, than perhaps we are.
president bush, when he talked earlier to reporters, mentioned that
this effort is an effort, this war is an effort to make the homeland,
our homeland, more secure. john king, that whole issue of homeland
security must be so much on the minds of so many government officials,
given the level of the terror alert today.

reporter: so far, so good is the assessment we're getting from senior
administration officials as they try to track what they worry about
most. as we have the strikes overseas throughout iraq, there will be
retaliatory terror strikes, either by organized terrorist networks or
sympathetic terrorists or people against the united states in this
country. so far, so good. no plans, we're told, to raise the threat
level, though it's already at orange, which is high. so microsoft of
the president's business has been behind the scenes today. he's the
most senior of about a handful of senior administration officials,
including the vice president and the secretary of state. the national
security advisor fanning out, we're told in phone calls to more than
three dozen world leaders offering them an update on what is going on.
but we did here hear from the president a bit earlier today. we see
baghdad, a capitol under siege. mr. bush in the cabinet room at the
white house to portray a different image, trying to show in
washington, it's business as usual, urgent business as, but still
business as usual with secretary of defense rumsfeld on one side,
secretary of state powell on the other. the president offered a brief
statement in the cabinet room.

call my cabinet together to review our strategies, to make the world
more peaceful, to make our country more secure. to make the lives of
our citizens as healthy and as prosperous as possible. we heard from
secretary rumsfeld who briefed us on the early stages of the war.
there is no question we've set the finest of our citizens into harm's
way. they performed with great skill and great bravery. we thank them.
we thank their loved ones. we appreciate their sacrifice. we heard
from secretary powell who briefed us on the ever-growing coalition of
the willing, nations who support our deep desire for peace and
freedom. over 40 nations now support our efforts. we're grateful for
their determination. we appreciate their vision, and we welcome their
support. as well, we discussed the need to make sure we have plans in
place to encourage economic vitality and growth. we will continue to
push for a medicare system compassionate for your seniors. we care
deeply about the fact that some children in our society can't read. we
want the best of education for every citizen in america. this cabinet
is confident about the future of our country. we're confident we can
achieve our objectives. i'm grateful for their service to their
country. thank you all.

reporter: so even at the very early stages of a defining moment of
bush presidency, the president trying to make the case his eyes and
especially the eyes of his cabinet still on the domestic affairs of
the united states as the early prosecution of the war continues. one
thing the president said that will be the point of contention around
the world, the president called it an ever-growing coalition of 40
countries. that is handful more nations that were actively involved in
the coalition his father assembled 12 years ago for the persian gulf
war, but there is a significant difference, of course. in this
coalition, it ips the united states doing the overwhelming load of the
fighting. british forces on the ground, australian troops scheduled to
take part, perhaps in some way. in the last gulf war, you had arab
forces on the ground. the egyptians, syrians, saudis, qataris taking
up arms to expel the iraqi armiy kuwait. no such participation this
time around. abc the president says, this is a growing coalition, this
is one of the big geo political debates going on around the world as
the president
