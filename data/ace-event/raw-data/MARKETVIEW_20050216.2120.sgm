Northshore Management, the hedge fund firm accused of stealing
millions of dollars in client funds, is now facing actual SEC action .
The amount in question: $37 million. While it's not a major sum compared
to the amounts consider before (as high as $90 million), it's good to
see that the issue's getting resolved.

Though, of course, there's always the chance that these fund managers
were stupid and shortsighted, not actually criminal; apparently, the
money stolen was lent to or invested in companies the managers
controlled -- so they're guilty of front-running, at the least. But they
might have been using Northshore as an alternative source of capital:
Having invested all they could risk, it would only make sense to turn to
other sources. What we'll need to look for in the coming weeks are 1)
What happened to the money once it was invested in these companies (were
they real companies, or just avenues for stolen funds?) and 2) How much
of this was disclosed beforehand.
