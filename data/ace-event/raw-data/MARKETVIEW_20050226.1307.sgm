We all know by now that Choicepoint allowed some highly respectable
Nigerian businessmen of impeccable credentials to view hundreds of
thousands of customer records for entirely legitimate purposes -- they
were paying customers, after all, and The Customer is Always Right. But
even after that huge mistake -- or rather, because of it -- the
company's top executives began dumping shares like mad . What's scary is
that since they started selling, the stock's down about 5%. Clearly,
they were expecting lots more damage. These insider sales were certainly
stupid, and probably criminal (though the legal proof may be hard to
come by) but the solution is easy enough: They need to buy stock from
the company itself, at some premium to the prices at which they sold --
they'll have the same stake as before, the shareholders would have
gotten their money back (since the premium goes to the company, which is
owned by the shareholders), and there's no need to disrupt their
business by taking the matter to court.

Or, if you want to do things the SEC's way, you could 1) Hire a bunch
of lawyers with the company's (shareholders') money, 2) Hire a legion of
PR firms to explain away that frivolous spending, 3) Hire a new
accountant to magically turn that spending into an investment
amortizable over twenty years, and 4) Settle out-of-court by having the
execs give the SEC some pittance (for which they'll likely be
compensated by the company) and a statement that "We neither admit nor
deny that we did what you claim, but we'll never do it again." Thank God
for the SEC -- they've practically made it a shareholder's utopia ,
here.
