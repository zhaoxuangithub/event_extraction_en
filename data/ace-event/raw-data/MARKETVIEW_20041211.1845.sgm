Scrappy underdog Netflix had its day earlier in the year, when it
became one of the hottest stocks around (sporting an eye-popping P/E in
the high 900's on the way up, and, thanks to a poor earnings report,
over 1,000 on the way down). There's plenty of argument about the future
of DVD and video rental, and Netflix represents a pure-play on one of
the three dominant hypotheses:

I. That business is O-V-E-R -- Between pay-per-view, video-on-demand,
pirated movies, high-bandwidth Internet broadcasts, and the increasing
availability of other media, it takes some faith to see any future for
movie rentals. Those who don't have the requisite faith will point to
these factors as proof that the business is dying and the movie business
in general will need a pretty significant overhaul before it can make
profits. Movie rentals are no longer a cheap alternative to other ways
of viewing films; they're the stodgy, expensive way. There aren't any
pure-play buys on this theory, but someone who believes it might
overweight their portfolio in cable companies -- if they purchased any
media stocks at all. Of course, there have been companies whose
performance would perfectly mimic the validity of this idea, but
Psuedo.com failed without producing a single show, and Broadcast.com was
swallowed for $6 billion by Yahoo!, to Yahoo!'s great regret.

II. Not so fast -- it'll just go online! -- Anyone who wants to
counter that argument would probably start by taking us back to 1997,
when in terms of time used, text was the most popular kind of
information online. At the time, and for years after, people argued that
the traditional bookstore would become obsolete. After all, how could we
stand for a rapaciously arborcidal medium like 'books' or 'newspapers'
when we could transmit the same data as bits and bytes and save on
transportation, too? As it turns out, of course, Amazon.com,
BarnseandNoble.com, and a host of others simply took the bookstore
model, attached a 56K modem, and declared themselves The Future. Netflix
is doing much the same thing: Taking the traditional business online to
cut costs and boost customer service.

III. Who d'you think you're kidding? You can't kill movie rental
stores -- So there's a big difference between movies and books: For
books, the retail store is practically the sole medium of distribution;
if you don't sell through them, books won't get sold. For movies, the
video rental store is just one way to get videos out there (though at
45-55% of studio revenues, it's a much more important one than people
think). But given the high valuations ascribed to
bricks-and-mortar-and-dead tree booksellers like Barnes and Noble ,
Borders , and to a much lesser extent Books-A-Million , surely there's
room for a Blockbuster , along with a Movie Gallery or two. The latter,
at least, still has room to grow. By focusing on smaller, rural
communities (preferably the sort that considers DSL 'newfangled')
they're WalMarting WalMart -- competing with Walmart's awful in-store
video rentals by offering better selection and much lower prices.

The movie business is changing dramatically as the potential for
online distribution grows, but like every other business it leaves lots
of room for traditional operators to operate at traditional (read: high)
profits. The aggressive bidding war for Hollywood Video , featuring two
of their competitors, a buyout shop, and one of the savviest raiders
around, is proof that some people still think these stores are worth
something. And I'm one of them.

Full Disclosure: For once, I'm actually writing about something I
own: I have shares of Movie Gallery, I've suggested it to friends, and
I'd be quite thrilled if the stock went up. I don't do 'sell targets',
but I'd probably hold the stock if it ran up anything less than 50% from
this level. If I sell, I'll post a notification one trading day
beforehand. Because Lord knows you care.
