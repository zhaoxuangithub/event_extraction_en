Back in the day (2000-2003 or so) some of the hottest
non-homebuilding stocks were the gaming equipment manufacturers , who
rode a wave of heavy reinvestment in casinos to produce huge profits.
Now, all that reinvestment has paid off, and, along with a good dose of
consolidation, made the industry moderately hot again.

Like every boom, whether merited or not, the big companies have big
moves in the early stage, but it doesn't get attention or turn into a
mania until we see a frenetic IPO or two. You know where this is going:
Las Vegas Sands kicked off its first trading day with a 60% gain after a
last-minute increase in offering price to $29 a share, outside the
$24-$26 range bandied about after they dropped their first $20-$22
estimate. But, well, the business is complicated and the business is
tough.

Wynn Resorts , another owner of the lucrative Macau license that
captured investors's attention during the IPO, illustrates this well
enough: Steve Wynn, the company's founder, made a gigantic fortune when
he bet his company's future on Atlantic City. When investors saw his
$160 million all-debt investment turn into a $440 million asset in just
a few years -- his net worth took a similar, though even less
gravitationally-bound arc, rising from $2 million to $75 million durign
the same time) they all rushed in. Needless to say, Wynn sold when
everyone else bought, and he made it through the cannibalizing
near-collapse those casinos faced in the early 90's.

So, applause and cheers all around to the casinos raising such
spectacular sums for your broad-scoped ambitions. And a premature
apology to the newly-minted shareholders, who will doubtless see some
eye-popping returns in the right direction for a little while and then
face a long road back to the reality that is a price around half the
current one.

Full disclosure, just for the hell of it: I was bearish about the
Google IPO, too. Thank God I didn't sell short
