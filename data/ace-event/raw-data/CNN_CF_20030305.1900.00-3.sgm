Look at Latest Evidence Against Iraq; Any Hope U.N., Old Europe will 
Come Around to Bush Administration's Way of Thinking?

<SPEAKER> CARLSON </SPEAKER>
Former Illinois Senator Carol Moseley-Braun recently decided to run for
president. Early reviews have not been good, so yesterday she announced
she'll be making some changes. Not to her ideas, which are few. Not to
her record, which is pretty embarrassing. Not even to her staff, which
is, of course, tiny. But to her name. From here on out, Carol
Moseley-Braun as Carol Moseley Braun. Did you catch the difference? In
the second version, there is no hyphen between her last names. Moseley
Braun expects that primary voters in Iowa and New Hampshire will react
enthusiastically to this radical, grammatical transformation. They'll
have to, because the latest CNN poll shows Moseley Braun far behind the
candidate she set out to discredit. That would be, of course, the
honorable Al Sharpton. Sharpton is not only by far the first choice of
black voters nationally, he is tied with Senator John Edwards among all
voters and beating Governor Howard Dean, Representative Dennis Kucinich
and Senator Bob Graham. Beating them. And Al Sharpton didn't even have to
change his name.

<SPEAKER> BEGALA </SPEAKER>
How did he become honorable?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> CARLSON </SPEAKER>
Yes!

<SPEAKER> BEGALA </SPEAKER>
You become honorable by winning an election of some sort or having a high
post, being an ambassador or a governor or some thing.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> CARLSON </SPEAKER>
By embodying the values of your party.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> BEGALA </SPEAKER>
Your values, not mine.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> CARLSON </SPEAKER>
He's the No. 1 pick, the most popular, among all candidates, among black
primary voters. I mean, you can't dismiss him. He's a serious candidate.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> BEGALA </SPEAKER>
We haven't even begun the primaries. He's not a serious candidate. He's
right wing fantasy and it's never going to happen.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> CARLSON </SPEAKER>
Not right wing. Take Al Sharpton seriously, that's our message tonight.
In a moment, we'll ask two members of Congress if they're convinced that
war is the only way to make Saddam Hussein disarm. Later, the pope
practices religion and a little anti-war politics on the side. Then, can
you spell prosthetic nose? Maureen Orth can, and she does in a new
"Vanity Fair" profile of Michael Jackson. We'll talk to her. You won't
want to miss that. We'll be right back.
