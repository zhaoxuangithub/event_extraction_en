Question?

<SPEAKER> CHRISTA DEMORE </SPEAKER>
Hi. I'm Christa Demore (ph) from Monrovia, Maryland. And I'm curious, how
can Democrats claim that President Bush is ignoring the war on terror if
al Qaeda's second key operative was just caught?
</TURN>

<SPEAKER> NOVAK </SPEAKER>
And it also proves you can even chew gum and walk at the same time.
Doesn't it show that?

<SPEAKER> BEGALA </SPEAKER>
He cannot eat a pretzel and watch a football became at the same time. So
I'm still doubtful of -- no, here's why. This is a serious point and you
deserve a serious answer. The way we caught that guy was by coordinating
with our allies. We now have a foreign policy in Iraq that is putting
enormous strain on those allies. The same weekend they arrested the guy,
we had...

<SPEAKER> NOVAK </SPEAKER>
We had no part in it.

<TURN>
<SPEAKER> BEGALA </SPEAKER>
No, it was a joint effort by Pakistan. Why do we want to sever that
relationship with this idiotic war in Iraq?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> NOVAK </SPEAKER>
We're not severing it -- question.

<SPEAKER> BEN CHARLTON </SPEAKER>
Hi. I'm Ben Charlton (ph) from East Lansing, Michigan. I was -- if we
wait for U.N. approval for action in Iraq, don't we sacrifice some of our
national sovereignty?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> NOVAK </SPEAKER>
Well, where are all of the conservative questions? We never have
conservatives in the audience. There's no question. I think even Paul
would agree with me. The question of whether we go to war or not is
strictly a national question. It's not a United Nations question.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> BEGALA </SPEAKER>
That is correct. The president has got all of the legal authorities he
needs. I just pray to god he doesn't use it. We need to go to the U.N.
because we want to build coalitions so we have support around the world
and so that we don't have to carry the burden ourselves. But legally he
has no obligation to go back to the U.N. From the left I am Paul Begala.
Goodnight for CROSSFIRE.

<SPEAKER> NOVAK </SPEAKER>
From the right, I'm Robert Novak. Join us next time for another edition
of CROSSFIRE.
