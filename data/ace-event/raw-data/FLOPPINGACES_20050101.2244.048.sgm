Europe Changing Their Tune?

American Future has a link up to a article written in yesterdays
Houston Chronicle. It describes how the European Governments look to be
changing their tune in regards to President Bush. Why you ask? But there
is arguably more to this sea change than just a grumpy acceptance of the
status quo. From a European perspective, three things are making it
easier to warm to the Bush White House.

One is the death of Yasser Arafat. No issue divides Europe and the
United States more keenly than the Israeli-Palestinian dispute. For the
last few years, Europeans have criticized Bush for failing to put enough
pressure on Israel to get out of the occupied territories and for
refusing to deal with Arafat. That another reason why I respect Bush so
much, his refusal to acknowledge that windbag terrorist Arafat. May he
rot in hell. But since Arafat's death, Europeans and Americans have been
able to find common ground: supporting Ariel Sharon's withdrawal from
Gaza, putting pressure on Israel to let the Palestinians hold elections
and, covertly, backing Mahmoud Abbas to become the next Palestinian
leader.

A second reason is Europe's growing worries about Islamic terrorism.
The murder in November of Theo van Gogh, a provocative Dutch filmmaker,
at the hands of an Islamic militant has been called Europe's 9/11.
Though the two events are obviously not fully comparable, it is
certainly true that American conservatives, such as Francis Fukuyama and
Bernard Lewis, have found a wider audience recently for the idea that
radical Islam is inimical to European traditions of tolerance. You mean
those radical muslims can be kinda nasty sometimes? Get outta
here....Keep doing business like the cowards in Spain and they will more
then likely have their very own 9/11 to cry about. The third force is
the reappearance, albeit in a milder form, of the threat that kept the
trans-Atlantic alliance together for half a century. The Russian bear is
growling again. The Ukrainian election --- complete with its KGB-style
poisoning of the opposition leader and heavy-handed electoral fraud --
has reminded European diplomats of Vladimir V. Putin's determination to
control his "near abroad." They should be very worried about this item,
I believe Putin is slowly sliding Russia back to what it once was.
Hopefully our Government isn't asleep at the wheel with this situation
either. There is a personal edge to all this. Just as the snooty
continentals eventually came to admire the gormless Hollywood actor,
there is a grudging willingness to rethink some prejudices about the
inarticulate Texan.

Many European leaders once swallowed the Michael Moore version of
history: that Bush was an ignorant interloper who stole the White House.
His thumping re-election, however, shows that he represents a large body
of conservative American opinion.

In short, Europeans are getting used to the idea that it is not Bush
who is the exception, but the U.S. itself that is exceptional --- and that
if they want to deal with this exceptional superpower they need to humor
it rather than rile it. Strangely enough, this has been Tony Blair's
strategy all along; it is rapidly becoming the Continent's strategy,
too. Couldn't of ended that article any better myself. Get used to it
France, we ain't going nowhere.
