Milosevic's wife to face trial

Slobodan Milosevic's wife will go on trial next week on charges of
mismanaging state property during the former president's rule, a
court said Thursday.

Mirjana Markovic, the power behind the scenes during Milosevic's
13-year reign, is accused of illegally providing their grandson's
nanny with a state-owned luxury apartment in Belgrade in 2000.

The Belgrade district court said that Markovic will be tried along
with 10 other Milosevic-era officials who face similar charges of
``inappropriate use of state property'' that carry a sentence of up
to five years in jail.

The trial will start on March 13, the court said.

Milosevic and his wife wielded enormous power in Yugoslavia for more
than a decade before he was swept out of power after a popular revolt
in October 2000. The post-Milosevic government later extradited him
to the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague, the Netherlands.

Since then, many of Milosevic's political and business allies as well
as his two children have been accused of crimes.

Markovic, the leader of the neo-communist Yugoslav Left party, lost
her parliamentary immunity from prosecution after she failed to
become a deputy in the parliament of Serbia and Montenegro, the
country that last month succeeded Yugoslavia.
