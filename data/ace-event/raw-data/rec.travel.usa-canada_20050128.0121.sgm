<SUBJECT> Comments on suggested travel plans through New England </SUBJECT>

Hi all,

I live in Austin, Tx, and being one who's only been as far as
Nashville, Tn two friends and I are planning a trip to New England for
a week. I'd love some insight or suggestions on our trip itinerary --

First i went to Expedia and did some flight checks. We're planning on
going July 4th week -- what better time to be in Boston I figure :)

Saturday, July 2nd
- Fly from Austin, Tx to Boston and stay with friends living in Boston

Sunday, July 3rd
- Hang around Boston and stay with friends

Monday, July 4th
- Hang around Boston and stay with friends

Tuesday, July 5th
- Leave early and drive to Niagara Falls, NY - 467 miles
- Stay in Niagara Falls

Wednesday, July 6th
- Leave from Niagara Falls and drive to Toronto, On - 85 miles
- Drive back to Niagara Falls that evening - 85 miles
- Stay in Niagara Falls

Thursday, July 7th
- Leave Niagara Falls and drive to Red Bank, NY - 435 miles
- Stay in Red Bank for the night
- We want to hit-up Jay and Silent Bob's Silent Stash

Friday, July 8th
- Drive back to Boston passing through New York -- do whatever
-- 262 Miles from Red Banks to Boston but add whatever miles from New
York
- Stay the night with friends in Boston

Saturday, July 9th
- Fly back to Austin

I figure staying in Red Bank, NJ, which isn't far from NYC, is cheaper
then staying in the city. Plus while driving back north to Boston we
can spend the day in NYC. I know there's WAY too much to do, but I
have another friend who works at the MET I'll try to hook-up with.
We'll plan our few hours in NYC wisely.

Also we're hanging in Boston for so many nights to visit with the
friends there and hit the sights in that area. Also this is a
vacation, so we hope to spend some time just chilling.

Any suggestions on changes? We have 3 people going, and Expedia shows
the flight (round trip) and a rental car with unlimited miles being
$1430, plus I'm figuring about $150 for gas and at $120 a night for
hotel that's $360 total for that.

So total cost (without food, spending cash, parking, toll roads, etc)
is $1910 or about $637 each. I'm figuring about $850 per person should
be plenty for everything -- and that's not bad for 7 nights in New
Enland with all the stuff we're planning.

Did I miss anything or does anyone see any suggestions or changes that
might either save money or make our trip more worthwild?

Thanks again, and take care,

Ringo

Oh -- what kinda weather can we expect up there during July? Texas is
in the 100's normally, so I hope the averages for July in New England
are a fare bit cooler :)

Unless there's something in particular you want to see in Toronto, I
don't see any reason to make this long side trip. I would suggest
heading back to Red Bank or wherever and trying to carve out an extra
day in New York City. You can find hotels in your price range,
especially with three sharing a room.

You might want to drop off the car somewhere near Red Bank, or as soon
as you arrive in New York, if the drop off charges aren't too much.
Then you could spend part of one day in New York (and a good part of
the next day, assuming you dropped Toronto). Then you could take the
train or bus back to Boston. It might work out cheaper in the long
run, especially when you consider the cost of parking in New York.

Hi Everyone,

Thanks for all the great replies!! This is exactly what I'm looking for
:)

The main reason I'd like to goto Toronto and Niagara Falls is mainly
because it's so close.. but I agree New York would be nice to spend a
few days in.

I know the bulk of our trip is in Boston, but we have friends living up
there we hope to spend a few days with visiting. The trip is both to
visit with them and to spend time around New England.

As for gas, what is the going rate for gas right now in New England?
Here in Texas it's around $1.60-$1.75 for Reg Unleadded, but i'm
figuring $1.90 a gallon. Is this not accurate? Here's how I figured
the price I'm factoring in --
Boston to Niagara Falls - 467 Miles
Niagara Falls to Toronto - 85 Miles and 85 Miles back
Niagara Falls to Red Bank, NJ - 435 Miles
Red Bank, NJ to Boston (plus spending some time in NYC) - 262

Total is 1334, but I'm figuring 1500 with some extra for around NYC and
various towns we visit. We're getting a mid-sized vehicle, so if the
car gets 20 mpg that's 75 gallons used. This times $1.90 is $145.50 or
around that. Even if gas is $2.00 a gallon that's still only around
$150, so I think $200+ for gas is a rather high estimate.

Also is it possible to take a train from Boston to NYC? If so how does
that work or what's the cost? I am from Texas where we drive
everywhere, and I've never even set foot on a train -- so forgive me if
this is a weird question :)

Thanks again for all the insight and help. Though I've never been up
there I've always wanted to see both Niagara Falls and Toronto, so
being so close I almost hate to miss an opportunity.

Take care,

Ringo
