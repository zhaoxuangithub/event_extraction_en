WASHINGTON, May 27 (AFP)

US President George W. Bush told Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien by telephone Monday that he looked forward to seeing him at
the upcoming summit of major industrialized nations and Russia, the
White House said Tuesday.

"The two leaders discussed the upcoming G-8 meeting, US-Canada
(relations) and other international issues of concern," Bush
spokesman Ari Fleischer said days before the June 1-3 summit, to be
held in France.

"Both said they look forward to seeing each other in Evian. They also
touched on Afghanistan, the situation in the Democratic Republic of
Congo and on the global economy," said Fleischer.

Amid a chill in relations over the war in Iraq, which Canada opposed,
Bush indefinitely postponed a visit to Canada, instead choosing to
host Australian Prime Minster John Howard, who endorsed that military
campaign.

On Monday, Chretien told reporters that he and Bush, who had not
spoken since late February, discussed a wide range of issues,
including Iraq, the upcoming summit of the Group of Eight industrial
powers and aid to Africa.

"We've always been on good terms. We just disagree on one item," the
Canadian leader said.
