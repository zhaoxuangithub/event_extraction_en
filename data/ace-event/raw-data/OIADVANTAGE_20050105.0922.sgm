Yesterday's bad day for Krispy Kreme included some speculation that
the new securities lawsuit filed against the company would be granted
class action status. If you are interested in getting information about
securities class actions for a company, you should check out the
Stanford Law School's Securities Class Action Clearinghouse . This site
has a very easy to use search function and it might be worth the time to
run a quick check on companies of interest to you as possible
investments.

Researchers affiliated with the clearinghouse just released an
interesting report about securities class action trends during 2004. The
results highlight trends in types of filings (increase in product market
related filings), affected sectors (big increase in energy &amp;
technology sector), and overall number of filings (fairly steady).
