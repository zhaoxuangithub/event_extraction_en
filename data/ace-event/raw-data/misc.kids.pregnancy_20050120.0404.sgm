<SUBJECT> The Pain of Childbirth </SUBJECT>

I have 2 girls already, nearly 8 and 4.5 yrs and I have always said I
will NEVER forget the pain of childbirth. Abby was a true water birth
(3kg - normal) and with Fiona I was dragged out of the pool after the
head crowned (gyno had written on my notes she was 4kg (large) and that
she was not to be born in the water (long painful story!) I can still
remember though the pain I felt. I am on the large side but I am so
worried about how I'm going to cope with a natural childbirth without a
pool (not available round here). I've seen videos and heard of ladies
who have "managed" their pain control. How in Heavens name can you do
that? I've been there; I know what the pain feels like!!

Can anyone give me advice or let me know of any techniques which might
be able to help? Thanks in advance.

If you don't have an institutional water birth available, have you
considered just staying home? Unassisted or midwife attended?

I understand hypnobirthing can be very helpful. I am not pursuing it
because I was able to go inside the pain to the good place without training,
last time.

I have not been thinking much about the hard part of labor prior to getting
so close. Now I remember how intense it is. I think I am still looking
forward to it more than fearing it, but hey. It's a really intense,
vulnerable thing.

If you go for a home birth you can rent a birthing pool.
I wouldn't necessaritly say that you will have a repeat labour!
My first labour I was 30 hours and had an epidural after 22 hours.
#2 I went in saying "give me the epidural asap-and never got to the state
where I felt that I needed it. Only had tens and gas-and-air. So don't give
up on the idea of a natural birth because last time was painful.
I think different people/different labours are different, so just because
one person says "I did *** and it didn't hurt a bit" doesn't mean that it
will work for someone else, so going in with a set of suggestions, and being
prepared to try them and see which is the best is probably the most helpful.
(Oh and "it didn't hurt a bit" is usually helped by mummy amnesia!!;-P)
