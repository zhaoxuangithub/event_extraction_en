night opens on the "uss john c. stennis." on this
deployment they primarily fly after dark so the ship's
schedule is upside down, the crew sleeps by day and works
all night. this is day two of war time operations for the
"stennis" and "operation iraqi freedom." for the next 12
hours into the morning, planes from the carrier will fly
missions over afghanistan. there is only a faint orange
light on deck, punctuated by this. to adjust their eyes for
night vision, crew members make their way through
passageways glowing in dim red light. on the flight deck, a
walkover check for debris is lit only by flashlight. the
dangers of the flight deck being blown overboard by jets,
slight sliced by propellers or other hazards that are hard
enough to avoid in daylight are all the more intense at
night. the intricate coordination of launch and recovery
plays out as a dance in the darkness. the complexity of it
all has been described as a ballet and if it is a ballet,
the choreographer of the flight deck is this man here. he
is the handler.
