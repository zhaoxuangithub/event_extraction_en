NEW YORK, March 23 (AFP)

Some 70 people were arrested Saturday as demonstrators clashed with
police at the end of a major peace rally here, as at least 200,000
anti-war protesters took to the streets across the United States and
Canada.

For the most part the marches went off peacefully, but in New York a
small group of protesters were arrested after they refused to go home
at the end of their rally, police sources said.

Several police officers were treated for the effects of gas after the
ensuing clashes -- a result, police said, of the demonstrators using
self-defence devices.

Organisers claimed that some 250,000 people attended the rally,
creating a human column some three kilometres (1.8 miles) long.
Police put the attandance at around 125,000.

The city assigned 2,000 police officers to the rally, including
undercover officers who carried beeper-sized radiation detectors and
other counter-terrorism equipment.

Though opinion polls have shown public support for the war rising in
the United States, opposition to military intervention in Iraq has
given rise to an impassioned campaign.

Among the sea of banners making its way up Broadway were many signs
poking fun at President George W. Bush. "Somewhere in Texas, a
village is missing an idiot," said one sign. "Iraq war: An unelected
extremist vs. an unelected extremist," and "Take the toys away from
junior."

One woman marched topless with the words "shock and awe" daubed
across her back in red ink, a reference to the bombing campaign
unleashed Friday on Baghdad.

Liana Owen drove 10 hours from Pennsylvania to attend the rally in
Manhattan with her parents. "It's important that people all over the
world know that we don't believe in the war," she said.

Several thousand demonstrators also gathered outside the White House
in Washington, accompanied by a major security presence.

"They can say they're 'smart bombs,' but smart bombs aren't able to
distinguish between military and human targets," Abigail Fletcher, a
marcher from Florida, said outside the president's residence.

Some of the slogans sought to rebut war supporters' arguments that
the protests are unpatriotic. "We support our troops -- bring them
home!" read one.

A former serviceman, Michael Schmidt of Peoria, Illinois, said: "It's
up to me to help the US -- from here."

Others were more blunt, with one banner reading "Shocked, Awed -- and
Disgusted."

One group, Lesbians Against Boys Invading Anything, carried signs
saying "Pre-emptive war is terrorism," "This isn't the USA I love,"
and "Where Will the Bombs Fall Next?"

Up to 20,000 protesters thronged the plazas and streets of San
Francisco, where more than 1,600 people were arrested in the past two
days in a civil disobedience campaign.

Between 2,500 and 3,000 people picketed the CNN studios in Los
Angeles while others at the Atlanta headquarters protested the cable
network's coverage of the war for being biased toward the United
States.

"They make this look like a John Wayne movie," said protester Elvis
Woods. "You watch CNN and all you get are explosions and video of
tanks and guns. Nobody questions whether this is right or not."

Counter-demonstrations in support of the US-led invasion of Iraq took
place in some cities, with some 2,500 people turning out in Chicago.
Flying the US flag and reciting the pledge of allegiance, they
outnumbered their anti-war counterparts by three to one.

Passions ran deep on both sides, but a line of police in riot gear
kept them apart. Carrying signs that said, "It's the oil, stupid,"
and "Real men don't bomb children," the anti-war protesters waved
blue Earth flags.

"I agree Saddam is crazy and needs to go, but it's not our place to
do it," said Ian Wisniewski, 14, who had a fake bullet hole painted
on his forehead. "It's crazy that we're bombing Iraq. It sickens me."

A few yards away, Claire Tortorello, 54, pointed and yelled at the
protesters across the plaza. Holding a framed picture of her son,
serving with the Army's 3rd Infantry Division in Iraq, she said she
didn't know whether he was dead or alive.

"I'm here to support him and others who are fighting for their
country. They wouldn't be here if it weren't for the freedoms that
others fought for," she said.

Anti-war protests took place around the world Saturday after the
start of the bombing of Baghdad. Hundreds of thousands of
demonstrators took to the streets in Britain, Spain and Italy, whose
governments approved of the war.

In Montreal, "Stop the War," a coalition of more than 190 groups,
said as many as 200,000 people turned out, though police refused to
give a figure.

Protesters also gathered in their thousands in Halifax, Calgary,
Edmonton and Vancouver.

Organizers of the civil disobedience campaigns promised to block
intersections and bridges, shackle themselves to lampposts and create
human cordons to snarl traffic, as long as the war continues.

Some 3,000 people have been arrested since the disobedience campaigns
began last week.
