The United States Navy and Coast Guard crews are providing port security
in the Persian Gulf during the Iraq war. And one group of sailors is
getting letters from elementary school children in North Carolina. The
students are getting inspiration from their teacher, who has a personal
connection, as CNN's Daryn Kagan reports.

<SPEAKER> DARYN KAGAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over) </SPEAKER>
It started as a story on port security, how U.S. Navy and Coast Guard
reserves are keeping ships safe from attack in Kuwait and Iraq. (on
camera): The mission of these units is to protect these ports.
(voice-over): But among the boats, guns, radar, sonar and communications,
we found a secret weapon posted on the side of the tent that serves as
the command center: letters from second-graders. Each one starts the same
way.

It turns out this is actually a story about a brother, Lieutenant

<SPEAKER> CHRISTINE CUPOLO, TEACHER </SPEAKER>
Yes, I do. My brother is in Kuwait.

<SPEAKER> ROBERTS </SPEAKER>
My sister is a grammar school teacher in Clayton, North Carolina.

<TURN>
<SPEAKER> CUPOLO </SPEAKER>
He was sent over right next to the Persian Gulf now since New Year's Eve.
And this is one of many deployments he's been on, but this one is
probably the most crucial.

<SPEAKER> ROBERTS </SPEAKER>
Her second-graders were very interested in sending some letters out to
the troops.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> CUPOLO </SPEAKER>
So, I knew that, at one point or another, my children needed to write. I
thought that would be a real uplifting experience for the troops.

<SPEAKER> ROBERTS </SPEAKER>
And she says: "Dear brave friend. Hello. My name is Amanda."

<TURN>
<SPEAKER> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE </SPEAKER>
"We would have to say that you are a very brave person. When the war
starts, your heart will be in our souls."
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> ROBERTS </SPEAKER>
For these kids to takes time to read letters to us and stuff like that in
their class, what more can you ask? Just keep it going.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> KAGAN </SPEAKER>
There will be more letters on the way. Back in North Carolina, the
Riverwood Elementary second-graders are working on the next batch.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> CUPOLO </SPEAKER>
Absolutely. You might want to mention that in your letter as well.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> KAGAN </SPEAKER>
This time, they hope the sailors will write back with answers to their
questions.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> CUPOLO </SPEAKER>
So you want to know how fast the dolphins there are swimming? OK. I would
write that down. I would say: "Dear, friend, I have some questions for
you. I want to know about the dolphins that are helping you out over
there." Can you do that? Do you think you could ask them a question?
Sure. They will be happy to answer it. We started work on our letters the
last week of February and worked on them the first week of March and sent
them out a few weeks ago. And they got the letters pretty quickly over
there. But I think this helps me stay closer to my brother.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> KAGAN (on camera) </SPEAKER>
Any message to your sister?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> ROBERTS </SPEAKER>
Yes. I'd just like to tell her, thank you very much, Christine. Hope
you're doing well in North Carolina. And thank you very much to your
students for all the support and the letters that they sent out to us.
