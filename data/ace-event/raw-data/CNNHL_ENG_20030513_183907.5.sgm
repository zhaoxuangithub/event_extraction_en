24 hours after a coordinated series of suicide bombings in saudi
arabia, the death toll is still rising. an eighth american has died.
in all, 21 people were killed, not including the nine suspected
bombers. nearly 200 people were injured. u.s. and saudi officials say
the bombings bear the trademark of al qaeda. they may have been timed
to coincide with the arrival of secretary of state colin powell in
riyadh. the state department is ordering all non-essential diplomats
and dependents out of the country. an fbi team is heading to saudi
arabia to help investigate the attacks. they targeted three
residential compounds for americans and other westerners.
