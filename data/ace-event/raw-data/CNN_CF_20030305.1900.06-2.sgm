Look at Latest Evidence Against Iraq; Any Hope U.N., Old Europe will 
Come Around to Bush Administration's Way of Thinking?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> CHRISTINA WRIGHT </SPEAKER>
My name is Christina Wright (ph). I'm from Minneapolis, Minnesota. And I
was just curious if you feel that the attack on Iraq would actually open
a Pandora's box in other Middle Eastern countries that we are known to
aid and harbor terrorists, such as Syria and Iran.

<SPEAKER> CARLSON </SPEAKER>
It might. I mean that's absolutely one of the fears. That it would
destabilize the entire region. On the other hand, the region is pretty
unstable, filled with people who already hate Americans and seek to do
America harm. So the question is, could it be worse?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> BEGALA </SPEAKER>
Our president believes it will set off a positive domino effect of
democracy through the region. Maybe he's right. I don't think he's
thought it through. I think it's more likely that this very unstable
region could cause even more problems.

<SPEAKER> CARLSON </SPEAKER>
Oh, come on. That's silly.

<SPEAKER> FABIAN </SPEAKER>
Hi. I'm Fabian from Bonn, Germany. And my question is, after today's
meeting in Paris, where France, Russia and Germany decided to not back a
second resolution, who is not (UNINTELLIGIBLE)? Is it the U.S. or is it
old Europe?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> CARLSON </SPEAKER>
It's actually Western Europe, because 18 European countries are on the
side of the United States. So France and Germany -- that's actually true
-- find themselves in the minority on their own continent. And good.

<TURN>
<SPEAKER> BEGALA </SPEAKER>
Only Great Britain is with us. The only country...
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> CARLSON </SPEAKER>
What do you mean only Great Britain?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> BEGALA </SPEAKER>
My question is not who votes at the U.N. Who sends troops to die on our
side? Nobody except Great Britain. We are isolated. From the left, I am
Paul Begala. Goodnight for CROSSFIRE.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> CARLSON </SPEAKER>
From the right, I'm Tucker Carlson. Join us again tomorrow night for yet
more CROSSFIRE.
