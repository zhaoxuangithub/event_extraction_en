Remember how you stress every year to get those #%^^$%# tax forms
filed on time? Just imagine how Nortel feels. Early on Tuesday Nortel
will be filing its 2003 financial statements . It also expects to
restate 2001 and 2002 earnings. None of this is really new information.
So the worst is behind them right? Maybe. Late filing of audited
financial statements and earning restatements both factor into my
External Reporting organizational indicator. As a rule, I am wary of
companies that do either of these things until I am confident that they
have changed their standard business practices. It may take a couple
years, and several more financial filings (on time of course), before I
am persuaded to take a second look at the company. The bottom line is
that I rely on SEC filings to assess companies and I don't want to have
any doubt about the veracity of the information contained in these
documents.

In Nortel's defense, they have just gone through the perfect storm in
the telecommunications equipment sector. The whole industry overbuilt
and got blindsided by the tech downturn. This could be described as a
growth industry that went on a bender and is now trying to recover from
the hangover. I've always felt that you learn a lot about someone when
you see how they try to recover from a hangover (pause for brief college
flashback). This is a great time to assess organizational effectiveness
in the telecommunications equipment industry. Nortel and Lucent
attempted to hide the damage (What do you mean? I'm not drunk!) and hope
for an uptick in demand before they would have to come clean. Both
companies have been penalized for these actions and have continued to
restructure operations, sell assets, and layoff employees. Cisco, on the
other hand, was able to take one huge restructuring charge in 2001 and
move forward. Their ability to do this and have it work (so far)
indicates a very deep and impressive understanding of their
organization. Especially when compared to its competitors, Cisco seems
to be back in fighting form due to it's ability to rapidly assess its
organizational structure and reconfigure to meet the changing market.
Not bad for a company with a hangover!
