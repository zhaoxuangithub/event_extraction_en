10. Death of Arafat (2) PLO leader PLO leader Yasser Arafat died in a
Paris hospital last week, after a lot of controversy surrounding his
illness and death.  What do you think caused his illness, and could it
have been something malicious (like poisoning)?  What do you think of
Israel's policies surrounding Arafat's illness and death?  Should
President Bush or a senior US official have attended Arafat's funeral?
Should Israel have let Arafat be buried in Jerusalem?

<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
Hi, I'm Paul. I'm in Delaware.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mike </SPEAKER>
Hi, this is Mike. I'm in California.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
Nice to meet you, Mike.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mike </SPEAKER>
Yeah, nice to meet you.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
Uh,  well,  pretty complicated -- topic.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mike </SPEAKER>
Yeah, interesting issue.  I don't know. What do you think? You think
it was poison?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
Well -- ((smoosh)) no, I I heard that just a couple of days ago and -- I I
kind of doubt it or at least I hope not. I guess that's what it is.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mike </SPEAKER>
Yeah, I don't think he was poisoned.  I think he was just fr- frail
and I think he'd been uh, he'd been looking frail and he was shaky.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mike </SPEAKER>
You know, he'd been looking h- like he was shaking and, uh,  seeming
frail.  For some time when I'd see him in public, uh,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
Yeah, that's true.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mike </SPEAKER>
presentation -- so forth.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
Right.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mike </SPEAKER>
And I think it whatever it was, it got him, just caught up with him
and and he reached the you know, the end of his time.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mike </SPEAKER>
So,  that's about it on that, I guess.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
Yeah.  Well, I I guess now that that he's he's died -- it'll be, uh,  or
it it should be a change for the ~PLO
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mike </SPEAKER>
Well, yeah, it'll be change. I I don't know if it'll move forward any
better -- but, uh, this, uh,  I've heard our administration thinks it
will. I think he was a block to the peace -- but I think it's not only
his doing, it's also the -- you know, the, uh, more, uh, drastic
elements of the ~PLO that, uh,  that, uh, wouldn't allow him to pursue
peace
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
Right.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mike </SPEAKER>
at any cost.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
Well, I'm -- I'm -- I don't know, uh.  He he seems like a guy who is much
more comfortable -- being under siege than in negotiating peace
settlements.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mike </SPEAKER>
Uh-huh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
Um, I
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mike </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
maybe that
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mike </SPEAKER>
Well, you know, he was kind of damned if he did and damned if he
didn't.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
Yeah.  Well
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mike </SPEAKER>
You know, if he if he made peace he had factions of his own people
that would've killed him -- and if he didn't make peace, eh, then he's
considered, you know, the the warmongering, uh, man who won't make
peace, you know.  So, he, uh, he couldn't really win. I don't think he
could make peace.  I don't know if anyone else can, either.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
Yeah, I guess that's the big question, if someone moderate takes over
and they reach a settlement,  does that mean the ~PLO will split?  I
mean that -- that could be just -- dangerous.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mike </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
I guess, uh, making peace with half of the Palestinians is better than
nothing.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mike </SPEAKER>
One of the other questions it asked us was, did we think our president
and our, uh, you know, officials should've attended his funeral.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
((Oh, I b-))
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mike </SPEAKER>
What do you think about that?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
Yeah.  Well, I I don't remember who they sent, but they did send over
some very -- low level state department person
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mike </SPEAKER>
Oh, I see.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
and, uh,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mike </SPEAKER>
I didn't know that.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
I I -- I was kind of embarrassed about that.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mike </SPEAKER>
That we did or d- that we did not send our officials.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
I mean -- We -- we did,  but i- it was some -- it was a nobody, basically.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mike </SPEAKER>
So you were embarrassed because you thought they should've sent
someone higher up?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mike </SPEAKER>
Oh, I see.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
I I -- I mean, for for the funeral ceremony in,  uh, Egypt.  ((I mean))
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mike </SPEAKER>
Yeah, I think so, too. I think they should've sent someone higher up.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
And, uh, I I can understand that they wouldn't want to send anybody
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mike </SPEAKER>
((that he)) -- Don't forget this was the this was the representative of
a whole people, you know what I mean?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mike </SPEAKER>
The past he was their main representative and, uh, just out of respect
for the people we should've sent someone I think.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
Hm.  Bad bad or good.  Yeah, I think it would've been a much more
positive message.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mike </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
((We realized that))
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mike </SPEAKER>
I think it would've, uh, you know, been a -- a step toward, um, you
know, gaining the, uh,  I don't know, the respect and and the, um,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
Right.  Yeah, I think that
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mike </SPEAKER>
uh, th- of the people that we're going to have to be working with to
try to bring about a peace, you know.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
that ((yeah,)) it -- Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mike </SPEAKER>
And, uh,  it would've -- gone an- a little farther to encourage them to,
you know, be willing to sit down at the table with us, at least, you
know.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
That's true.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mike </SPEAKER>
And, I mean not that it would've even been noticed -- in that regard had
he -- had had our president or someone higher gone, but the fact that
they didn't, that's what's really going to be noticed, you know what I
mean?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
Yeah.  Well, uh, you know,  Colin Powell is a -- pretty moderate guy and
would've been nice to see him there or maybe -- the, uh,  Deputy -- Secret
of State.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mike </SPEAKER>
Uh-huh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
I'm not even sure who that is.  Eh,  somebody will -- or higher up.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mike </SPEAKER>
Yeah, someone m- a little more, uh
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
Some flunky bureaucrat.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mike </SPEAKER>
yeah.  Yeah, it didn't seem quite appropriate.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
But, uh, at at least for the ceremony in Egypt I think, uh,  I can
understand that no one would want to go into -- Palestinian territory. I
mean,  they it was total chaos there.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mike </SPEAKER>
Uh-huh.  Sure.  Yeah.
