North Korea says Security Council's handling of nuclear issue is 'a
prelude to war'

SEOUL, South Korea (AP)

North Korea on Sunday rejected the U.N. Security Council's plan to
discuss the standoff over its suspected nuclear weapons development,
calling it ``a prelude to war.''

Meanwhile, South Korean officials said Cabinet-level talks scheduled
this week between the two Koreas looked unlikely to take place. Seoul
had hoped to use the meeting to try to persuade its communist
neighbor to scrap its nuclear ambitions.

The Security Council is scheduled to discuss North Korea's nuclear
program on Wednesday, and Pyongyang has said that any sanctions
imposed on it will be tantamount to war.

The U.N. discussions are ``a grave provocation act intended to
scuttle all (the North's) effort for dialogue and aggravate the
situation on the Korean Peninsula,'' a North Korean Foreign Ministry
spokesman was quoted as saying by state-run news agency KCNA.

The Security Council's ``handling of the nuclear issue on the Korean
Peninsula itself is precisely a prelude to war,'' the spokesman said.

For months, North Korea has insisted on direct talks with the United
States to negotiate a nonaggression treaty.

Washington has refused, saying a multilateral solution to the crisis
was needed. The U.S. administration has been pressing the Security
Council to adopt a statement condemning Pyongyang for failing to meet
its obligations to prevent the spread of nuclear arms.

But KCNA quoted the spokesman as saying that the U.S. invasion of
Iraq showed that Washington was not bound by international
agreements. A nonaggression treaty with Pyongyang would not
necessarily avert war because it may not be honored, he said.

It was not immediately clear if Pyongyang would drop its demand for a
nonaggression pact.

North Korea also said Washington is ``seriously mistaken'' if it
thinks that the communist country will accept the U.S. demand to
disarm. It said it will ignore any U.N. resolution on the nuclear
issue.

If the U.N. Security Council cooperates with U.S. efforts to
``stifle'' North Korea, it would leave the North with ``no other
option but to beef up the deterrent force for war by mobilizing all
the potentials,'' KCNA quoted the Foreign Ministry spokesman as
saying.

For weeks, North Korea has claimed that the United States plans to
attack it after Iraq. Washington says it seeks a diplomatic end, but
has not ruled out a military solution.

Last year, U.S. President George W. Bush said North Korea was part of
an ``axis of evil'' along with Iraq and Iran, and that it was
developing weapons of mass destruction.

South Korea has tried to keep a lid on rising tensions between
Washington and Pyongyang.

But officials in Seoul said Sunday that North Korea had yet to
confirm that Cabinet-level meetings scheduled to begin Monday in
Pyongyang would go ahead. Seoul had hoped to use the three-day talks
to try to persuade its communist neighbor to scrap its suspected
nuclear program in return for aid and better relations with the
outside world.

North Korea called off two working-level talks with South Korea last
month.

Also on Sunday, South Korean lawmakers said they would work to
quickly set up a special parliamentary committee to deal with the
North's nuclear issue.

The nuclear standoff began in October, when U.S. officials said North
Korea admitted having a secret nuclear program in violation of a 1994
agreement.
