Well, it's mid-morning on the East coast and I am sitting here
running numbers thru my head trying to figure out what's going to happen
in the Iron Bowl, which is just over 29 hours away.

The game is being played in Tuscaloosa, which should be an advantage
to Alabama. However, In the two times the game has been played in Bryant
Denny Stadium, Auburn has won.

Alabama has one of the stingiest defenses in the country, and were
ranked number one in overall defense as recently as last week.
Conversely, Auburn has one of the most potent and balanced offensive
attacks in the nation. Also, I don't think Bama has faced an attack with
two great runners, a great line, a poised QB and good receivers and a
tight end as well.

Bama is missing it's starting offensive backfield from the start of
the season. The fact that they've won six games is a testament to the
coaching and heart of the players.

Alabama simply cannot throw the football, which is a good thing,
because Auburn's defensive backfield is second to none. Bama can run the
ball however. Unfortunately for them, with no passing game to keep the
defense honest, Auburn will probably stack nine in the box, play man on
the corners, and dare Bama to run, and I don't think they'll be able to
do it.

Auburn is also 9-0 when they score first. The Tuberville way is to
get one quick and early to get your crowd into it if you're at home and
to quiet the other team's crowd if you're on the road.

You can never tell what is going to happen in rivalry games. In this
exact game 15 years ago, Bama came into Auburn #2 in the country,
undefeated at 10-0 and looking for yet another national championship.
They were summarily trounced 30-20 in a game in which the score was
closer than the actual game. That could very well happen Saturday.

I always tell people that the Georgia game matters more to me than
the Bama game. I live in Georgia, and losing that game affects me much
more directly than losing the Alabama game. That said, when kickoff time
comes, you remember all the reasons that you hate Alabama and their
dumbass haircuts and their detergent and toilet paper and their
houndstooth hats and their "Bear this" and "Bear that," and everything
else that goes along with it. This isn't a football game, and it's not
two drunken cousins fighting at a family reunion. This is brother
against brother after one slept with the other's wife and then bragged
about it. It's THAT serious.

However, when it's all said and done, I just don't think Alabama has
the horses to stand up to what I believe is going to be enormous
defensive pressure. If Auburn takes care of the ball and executes, this
game shouldn't be as close as some think.

My call:

Auburn 37

Alabama 13

Now pass the Tums. I don't feel so well...

War Eagle!!
