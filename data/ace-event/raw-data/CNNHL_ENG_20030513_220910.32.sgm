i'm alisha davis. used to be the king of pop. now you could call him
the king of lawsuits. michael jackson filed suit against universal
music, the parent company of motown records saying he owe him for
music he recorded with the jackson five back in the 1970s. the gloved
one claims the label has been releasing new albums and jackson five
merchandise without giving him "a single dollar." jackson has been in
and out of courtrooms lately. in recent months, he's been sued by an
auction house for non-payment, and by a concert promoter for allegedly
backing out of two millennium performances.
