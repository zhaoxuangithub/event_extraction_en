Perhaps Father Simpson was too busy telling reporters how hot he
thinks his daughter, Jessica, is to wake and up and realize that his
other daughter, Ashlee, is making a complete fool of herself.

Back in November I linked to this fraud's malfunctioned SNL
performance when a technical glitch caused the vocal track from her
first song to repeat during the second, proving she lip-synchs, even
though she has been quoted saying she doesn't.

The humiliation and assault-on-music continued last night, when for
some reason she decided to use her own voice in a wretched halftime
performance at the Orange Bowl which ended in a shower of boos. You can
see the video here if you can stand to watch a young no-talent wannabe
continue to humiliate herself in public.

The best thing Ms. Simpson can do at this point is to just stop
trying and end her music career. She has already made enough money from
her debut album (never again) to live out the rest of her life in some
secluded California mansion. There is nothing more to the story.
