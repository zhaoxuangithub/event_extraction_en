Planned Parenthood, one of the worst organizations in the country,
has been distributing poor condoms -- which liberals believe should be
freely available in all high school clinics nationwide -- according to
Consumer Reports which released its rankings this week. From
Sun-Sentinal : Two of the three types of free condoms offered by Planned
Parenthood received poor ratings, according to rankings that appear in
the February issue of Consumer Reports, which hits newsstands Wednesday.

Planned Parenthood has since redesigned its "Honeydew" condom, which
was the magazine's lowest-ranked brand with two "poor" ratings in
strength and reliability. The group resubmitted all three of its brands
for independent testing and received "excellent results," said Karen
Pearl, president and chief executive of Planned Parenthood of Nassau
County. The group's "Assorted Colors" brand was ranked next-to-last with
a "poor" mark for strength but an "excellent" for reliability. The
"Lollipop" got an overall "excellent" rating. Pretty scary that poorly
rated condoms have been available to teens, both those looking for free
sex and those who happen to attend public school. Even worse, it took a
whistleblower to get Planned Parenthood to strengthen its product.

Lollipop anyone?
