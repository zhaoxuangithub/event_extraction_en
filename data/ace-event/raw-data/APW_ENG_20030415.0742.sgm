U.S. and Iraqis look to form new government, but some groups boycott
meeting

UR, Iraq (AP)

A U.S.-sponsored forum that brought Iraqi opposition leaders together
to shape the country's postwar government began Tuesday with a U.S.
promise not to rule Iraq and concluded with an agreement to meet
again in 10 days.

Meeting in the biblical birthplace of the prophet Abraham, delegates
from Iraq's many factions discussed the role of religion in the
future government and ways to rebuild the country. But some Shiite
Muslim groups boycotted the meeting and thousands protested nearby.

A 13-point statement released after the meeting stressed the need to
work toward a democratic Iraq built on the rule of law and equality.
It also called for dissolving Saddam's Baath Party but left open the
question of separating church from the state.

Retired Lt. Gen. Jay Garner, who will head the U.S.-led interim
administration in Iraq, opened the conference under a golden-colored
tent in the shadows of the 4,000-year-old ziggurat at Ur, a terraced
temple platform of the ancient Sumerians.

``What better birthday can a man have than to begin it not only where
civilization began but where a free Iraq and a democratic Iraq will
begin today?'' said Garner, who turned 65 Tuesday and wore a twin
American and Iraqi flag pin on his blue shirt.

White House envoy Zalmay Khalilzad told delegates that the United
States has ``no interest, absolutely no interest, in ruling Iraq.''

``We want you to establish your own democratic system based on Iraqi
traditions and values,'' Khalilzad said. ``I urge you to take this
opportunity to cooperate with each other.''

Participants included Kurds, Sunnis and Shiites from inside the
country and others who spent years in exile. U.S. officials invited
the groups, which picked their own representatives.

Many Iraqis boycotted the meeting in opposition to U.S. plans to
install Garner atop an interim administration. Thousands of Shiites 
_  who constitute Iraq's most populous religious group but were
repressed under Saddam Hussein	_  demonstrated in nearby Nasiriyah,
chanting ``No to America and no to Saddam!''

``Iraq needs an Iraqi interim government. Anything other than this
tramples the rights of the Iraqi people and will be a return to the
era of colonization,'' said Abdul Aziz Hakim, a leader of the largest
Iraqi Shiite group, the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in
Iraq.

U.S. officials hope more Iraqis join the process and stressed that
this was just the first of many such meetings in Iraq. The meeting
concluded with the delegates voting by show of hands to meet again in
10 days.

A national conference is planned to select the interim
administration, perhaps within weeks, a senior U.S. official said on
condition of anonymity.

The interim administration could begin handing power back to Iraqi
officials within three to six months, but forming a government will
take longer, said Maj. Gen. Tim Cross, the top British member of
Garner's team.

``One has to go through the process of building from the bottom up,
allowing the leadership to establish itself, and then the election
process to go through and so forth,'' Cross said. ``That full
electoral process may well take longer.''

Garner's Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance is
charged with coordinating humanitarian assistance, rebuilding
infrastructure shattered by years of war and U.N. sanctions, and
gradually handing back power to Iraqis leading a democratically
elected government.

Tuesday's meeting was the first step toward that goal after the
ouster of Saddam.

Sheik Ayad Jamal Al Din, a Shiite religious leader from Nasiriyah,
urged the delegates to craft a secular government, according to a
pool report. But Nassar Hussein Musawi, a schoolteacher, disagreed:
``Those who would like to separate religion from the state are simply
dreaming,'' he said.

Iraqi exile Hatem Mukhliss quoted President John F. Kennedy's
exhortation, ``Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you
can do for your country,'' and called on Iraqis to write a
constitution, establish a legal system and consider what role the
army should play.

He asked coalition representatives to address problems of security,
electricity and water in Iraq and help rebuild destroyed and looted
hospitals.

``Saddam reduced the country to such a state that it was necessary
for people to sell off personal possessions,'' Mukhliss said. ``Now
it's time to take our country back.''

There are already tensions between the United States and some Iraqi
factions.

Kurdish groups appear unwilling to compromise on their demand to
expand the border of their autonomous area to include the oil-rich
city of Kirkuk and Kurdish parts of the city of Mosul.

That could pose a problem for the United States, because Turkey
worries that Kurdish control of Kirkuk could lead to aspirations for
independence and in turn encourage separatist Kurds in Turkey.

Iraqi opposition leaders fear the United States is trying to force
Ahmed Chalabi, head of the London-based umbrella Iraqi National
Congress, on them as leader of a new Iraqi administration.

Chalabi was the first top Iraqi opposition leader to be airlifted by
the U.S. military into southern Iraq as the fighting wound down, and
he and other top members of his group plan to meet soon in Baghdad.
U.S. officials said Chalabi was brought in because he offered forces
to the coalition.

Neither Chalabi nor many other leaders of anti-Saddam groups attended
Tuesday's meeting, but they sent delegates.

Iraqis protesting the conference said it did not represent their
interests. The protesters held banners written in English and Arabic
saying the ``Hawza,'' or the Shiite religious seminary in Najaf,
represents them.

Even some of those at the meeting said they did not want Garner
leading the interim administration.

``We will press for any Iraqi civilian administration regardless of
what the Americans say. An administration by Garner is not
acceptable,'' said Mowaffak al-Rubaie, an Iraqi physician and
opposition activist.

He said American officials have outlined what Garner's administration
would look like: Each ministry would be headed by an American, either
military or civilian. Each minister would have two American deputies
and eight American advisers, plus four Iraqi advisers from inside the
country and four Iraqi exiles.	     _  _  _  =
