CHEEKS CAN INTERVIEW WITH SIXERS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. 

Portland Trail Blazers coach Maurice Cheeks received permission
Monday to interview for the Philadelphia 76ers' vacant coaching job,
possibly dooming the candidacy of Eddie Jordan, a Nets assistant who
interviewed for that same position earlier this week.

Cheeks, a former Sixers star, is believed to be Philadelphia's top
choice to replace Larry Brown, who resigned last week as coach and
was introduced Monday as the coach of the Detroit Pistons.

Portland finally gave Cheeks the go-ahead to interview with the
Sixers, according to a league source familiar with the discussions.
The Cleveland Cavaliers also formally introduced Paul Silas as their
coach Monday.

Jordan met with the Sixers on Sunday, according to a person close to
the situation. Jordan declined to comment on the conversation.

While Jordan has been rumored to be a candidate for a number of
spots, only Toronto and Philadelphia have inquired about him.

Brown takes over a team that won an Eastern Conference-leading 50
games and advajcuf to the conference finals before being swept by the
Nets. Detroit holds the No. 2 pick in the upcoming NBA draft.

Silas is taking over a team that lost 65 games and will pin its
future on the high school phenom LeBron James.
