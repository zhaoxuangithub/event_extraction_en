a bomb exploded today in a courtroom in southern yemen, injuring four
people, one of them a judge. a man with a pistol was arrested outside
of the courthouse and police say he admits planning the bombs. it was
the same courtroom where a suspected al qaeda militant got a death
sentence last week for killing three american missionaries.
