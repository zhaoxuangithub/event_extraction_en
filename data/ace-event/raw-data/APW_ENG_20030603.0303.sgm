South Africa's Supreme Court of Appeal ruled Tuesday against a state
request to retry the head of apartheid's germ warfare program, once
accused of plotting to poison Nelson Mandela.

Wouter Basson was acquitted in April 2002 on 46 charges, ranging from
murder and drug trafficking to fraud and theft.

Basson was accused of directing South Africa's former apartheid
regime's biochemical efforts aimed at destroying its opponents.

The ruling by judges Piet Streicher and Mohamed Navsa of the Supreme
Court of Appeal, the highest appeals court in the country, means that
Basson cannot be tried again and his acquittal stands, the South
African Press Association reported.

The state's appeal was based on the judge refusing to recuse himself
during Basson's 2 1/2-year trial. The prosecution alleged presiding
Judge Willie Hartzenberg favored Basson.

The appeal judges found Hartzenberg's refusal did not relate to an
error of law on his part.

Basson headed a program named Project Coast in the 1980's.

During the trial witnesses testified that the project involved trying
to create deadly bacteria and anti-fertility drugs that would only
affect blacks. They poisoned opponents' clothing and stockpiled
cholera, HIV and anthrax.

The alleged intended victims included former President Nelson Mandela
and several African National Congress leaders who are now
high-ranking government officials.

He had also been accused of siphoning millions of dollars from
Project Coast to finance a lavish, globe-trotting lifestyle and of
selling drugs.	       (sapa-es-dk)
