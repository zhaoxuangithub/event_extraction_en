comes with someone involved in case of a 22-year-old
disabled woman in florida. they talk about her current
predicament. a mind of toddler. raped while in state care,
pregnant. and forced in the spotlight when jeb bush tried
to get a guardian appointed for her fetus. predicament goes
hard enough to describe that. to continue a pregnancy that
her lawyer says she is not aware of but the decision wasn't
based on the advice of the governor. here's cnn's susan
candyioti.

reporter: we know her only by her initial, this mother to
be, jds. only 22 years old with no known family. police say
she has the mental capacity a 1-year-old. according to
court filing, jds has cerebral palsy and she's autistic.
she didn't become pregnant by choice, she was raped, police
say in a group home overseen by the state of florida. jds
is now more than six months pregnant. since she's incapable
of make her own decision, a florida judge based his
decision on below to give birth on the recommendation. two
doctor agreed jds is, "in good health," two sono grams
reveal, no obvious or significant fetal abnormalities.
although, jds is autistic, a guardian says jds appears to
be responsive north just setting in a semiconscious state
all the time. still undecided, an appeal by governor jeb
bush, who wants the guardian apointed for the fetus. he
says the unborn child must be protected. however, a
spokesman for the governor says he calls the court ruling
for jds, not to abort the baby, compassionate and humane.
last month in miami, a judge ordered an abortion for
another severely disabled raped woman who had been living
this a state-regulated home. in that case, the young
woman's mother approved the abortion.

and in this case, there are a lot of unanswered questions
still. for example, what will happen to the baby, and what
will happen to jds? of course, according to the guardian,
she's very worried about that, too, and she has warned the
court that she hopes the mother will be placed in a better
home when all of this is over, one where she is far better
protected than she was by the state in a home where police
say she was raped. aaron?
</TURN>
<TURN>
well, two questions. do they know who the rapist is? that's
sort a yes or no, i suppose. and the other is, has the
state done anything? is it doing anything to tighten up
security in these places with respect defenseless people
are being attacked?
</TURN>
<TURN>
reporter: well, first of all, regarding the rape, they hope
to find out who the father is once she gives birth because
they will analyze dna from the baby in order to try to
determine paternity in this case. and the governor has
ordered a panel of experts now to study this issue of
security, far better security than is clearly needed for
people such as this woman, jds, living in group homes.
</TURN>
<TURN>
well, we will wait for the report. thank you, susan. susan
candiotti in florida. coming up on "newsnight," a
cease-fire in the middle east, is there one or is not lots
of talk. actions say different. we'll talk to a palestinian
legal representative, their legal adviser when we continue
from new york.
