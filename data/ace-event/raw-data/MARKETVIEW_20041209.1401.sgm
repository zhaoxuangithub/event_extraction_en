Shares of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia , a company whose name is
so breathtakingly self-promoting it makes me long for the days when
every single entity involve in real estate or casinos was called Trump,
continues to soar; it rose $1.78, or 7.29%, on news that the company's
namesake will star in a new TV show once she, er... gets out of prison.
Now, I know there have been succesful companies that dealt with crooks
(Warner Communications, which started as a merger between business in
the three most mob-influenced industries around, comes to mind), but
it's a gamble and not a business strategy.

The company's performance wasn't all that hot even before the CEO
went to prison, and until very recently the stock price reflected that.
But this is a one-person company, and at this point it's saying the
'Martha' brand is worth some $1.31 billion. If anything, the value of
the brand should decline over time, inasmuch as she's rather, well,
mortal. And she's been convincted of obstruction of justice. This runup
is based on the inexplicable hope that now that the head of the firm and
the embodiment of a much-resented brand is no longer doing time for
lying to the Federal government, they'll be able to really coin some
money. I just don't know what to say.

Martha should do a reality show. Take 10 contestants, and give them a
situation: You have company coming over for dinner; You're hosting an
open house; or, You're hosting a wedding reception. Then, she just ranks
them and eliminates one every week. The stock would really go to the
moon on that press release.
