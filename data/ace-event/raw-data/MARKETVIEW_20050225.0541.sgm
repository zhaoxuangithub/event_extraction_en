Well, I would, too. On the other hand, the Russian legal system is a
bit less, well, legalistic -- they seem much more concerned about the
chance that someone will harm the state than about actual matters of
right and wrong. So it's pretty significant that Mikhail Khodorkovsky is
taking the risk of maintaining his innocence . At this point, he has
essentially no chance of recovering anything, unless Russia sees a
change in political control and the US applies some pressure.
