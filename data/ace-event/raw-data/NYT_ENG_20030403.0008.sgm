WASHINGTON _ Having punched through severely depleted Republican
Guard divisions that formed Baghdad's outer defensive ring, U.S. Army
and Marine forces are likely to pause again to test the Iraqi
capital's inner defenses and waall but evaporated under the weight of
the U.S. assault. Their collapse left the U.S. troops less than 20
miles from Saddam Hussein's capital. Bet`fow Central Command chief
Gen. Tommy Franks and his field commanders face a big decision _
whether to rush into the city of 5 million where Hussein's regime has
gathered its most-trusted forces or wait and see if the war can be
won without paying the price of street-to-street urban fighting.

``We are expectingn or at least planning for, a very difficult fight
ahead,'' Gen. Stanley McChrystal said at the Pentagon Tuesday. ``We
are not expecting to drive into Baghdad suddenly and seize it.''

Instead of an all-out assault, analysts expect the United States to
follow the example of British forces outside the southern Iraqi city
of Basra. They are likely to mount small probing patrols into the
city to determine the level of Iraqi resistance.

If these patrols meet little opposition, thousands of troops could
rush into the city. If the Iraqis respond forcefully, the Army and
Marine units could withdraw and await the 4th Mechanized Infantry
Division, which will soon start moving north from Kuwait. While they
wait, the forces would try to determine where Iraqi strong points are
within the city and where Hussein might be, if he is still alive.

``The Basra model will work for a while, at least until you see
problems with food and water for civilians in the city,'' said
Lawrence Korb, an analyst at the Council on Foreign Relations who was
assistant defense secretary under former President Ronald Reagan.

``Before going in (with a full assault), you have to decide if it's
worth the risks, and ... you have to know who's there in the way of
Iraqi forces and the amount of potential damage to civilians,'' he
said.

The administration has said it wants to minimize casualties to Iraqi
civilians, which makes the British experience around Basra
instructive, the analysts said. The British have been outside the
city of 1.5 million for more than a week. Thousands of refugees have
fled the city, apparently providing information to the British that
has led to raids on military and Baath Party sites in the city.

``The key endgame may be whether the U.S. can parse out the key
regime centers of power in Baghdad and attack them without having to
fight into the city, or at least locate them well enough to atman of
the Center for Strategic and International Studies said in his daily
war report.

U.S. strategists say that Hussein, if he is still alive and in
control of his forces, might like a bloody battle in Baghdad because
such fighting could cause heavy U.S. casualties. His last hope for
survival might be that the United States loses its taste for such
losses and forces President Bush to negotiate a compromise that would
allow Hussein and his family to keep power in Baghdad.

But Michael O'Hanlon of the Brookings Institution in Washington said
the apparent collapse of Republican Guard resistance could deprive
Hussein of much of the wallop he was counting on in the city.

``If U.S. forces seriously degrade Iraq's half-dozen Republican Guard
divisions before that final battle, and only have to face perhaps
30,000 Special Republican Guard, fedayeen, and related personnel, the
task will not be as hard as it might have been,'' he said.

While two guard divisions have apparently been smashed, there are
three others in the Baghdad area. A sixth remains in northern Iraq.

Cordesman said it seems the guards have been reinforced by units from
the regular Iraqi army, which is generally viewed as less reliable.
This shows the Iraqi military's growing weakness, he said.

``The Republican Guard has taken a massive hammering at every level
and is now scattered and deploying somewhat erratically at the
brigade level,'' he said.

The Iraqis still haven't used chemical weapons, even though many
experts feared such attacks as the U.S. troops neared Baghdad. Korb,
who's convinced Hussein has stocks of chemical weapons he never
reported to U.N. inspectors, said he wouldn't be surprised if Hussein
tried to use them.

But he also said, ``He may destroy them to embarrass us,'' to show
the world he never had such weapons and that Bush invaded for no
reason other than aggression.

The U.S. forces zeroing in on Baghdad _ the 1st Marine Division from
the east and the Army's 3rd Mechanized Infantry Division _ are
trained in urban warfare. But in such close-quarters fighting, they
would lose much of the technological advantage of their air
supremacy, which would have to be curtailed because bombing in a city
can cause large civilian casualties.

However, Baghdad from the air looks like Los Angeles _ wide, straight
boulevards intersected by side streets in a grid pattern. ``Our
forces would be capable of dealing with it reasonably. But there
would be lots of casualties on all sides,'' Korb said.
