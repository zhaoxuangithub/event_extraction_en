the big focus is american airlines, the board of the
company meeting today, possibly discussing the future of
ceo don carty, he got in trouble when he jacked up pensions

it's one of the parts of america that is great. people want
more and they want other people to have less. that's part
of the system. and annual meeting, every year, i went they
complained about executive salaries, even though the team
that i managed increase shareholder value to $600 billion
that sharoners received, the larger share orns being
employees.

i think it's really a question of degree, i mean, i think
that ceos should make millions of dollars running
companies, there are tens of thousand employees, billions
of dollars of revenue. a million dollars is okay, maybe 5

the board is who decides that and board is so often chock
full of the ceos golfing buddies, they serve on each
other's boards and problem here is gap between what the
average worker makes and ceo is making is increasing and
everyone agrees that is not a good thing for this country,
plus the fact, when the guys get the big packageses, so
often you see the companies going down the zblubs thank you
for updating us. back over to bill.
