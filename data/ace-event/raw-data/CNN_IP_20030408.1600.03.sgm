And, as we listened to John King's report, we can tell you that President
Bush has just -- his plane has just landed at Andrews Air Force Base,
just close to the Washington area, the president having flown back to the
United States from that meeting in Northern Ireland in Belfast with the
British prime minister, Tony Blair. You just heard John reporting about
it. They primarily talked about the war in Iraq, the aftermath of Iraq.
But they also discussed the Middle East and, as well, getting the
Northern Ireland peace process started up again. It has been said that
Saddam Hussein ruled Iraq with an iron fist. I guess you can say in the
past tense. His regime has left behind some disturbing evidence to
support those claims. The abandoned secret police headquarters in Basra
is just one example. ITN's Bill Neely is with the Royal Marines and he
takes us on a tour of Basra's chamber of horrors.

<SPEAKER> BILL NEELY, ITN REPORTER (voice-over) </SPEAKER>
Saddam Hussein's Iraq is a state of terror, and this is where it's
planned and perpetrated, the headquarters of his secret police, this one
in Basra. No British soldier has been here yet. Today, as I walked in, I
met Iraqis, none of whom had ever been inside willingly. What was to
follow was a horrific education in terror and torture: in the smoking
basement of the bombed building, a warren of cells. Here, prisoners were
tortured.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> UNIDENTIFIED MALE </SPEAKER>
Yes, of course.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> NEELY </SPEAKER>
People died.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> UNIDENTIFIED MALE </SPEAKER>
People died, people in prison without court, without trial.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> NEELY </SPEAKER>
Any people who Saddam did not like.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> UNIDENTIFIED MALE </SPEAKER>
Of course. Of course.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> NEELY (voice-over) </SPEAKER>
The building is crumbling. Down we went, further to cells that had no
light, little air, cockroaches, filth, and, on the ground, a gas mask and
bottles of chemicals.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> UNIDENTIFIED MALE </SPEAKER>
You can imagine this every day, every month. So many people come here,
but we don't know about them at all.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> NEELY </SPEAKER>
These ordinary Iraqis had been terrified to come here, until today,
though one student on the left had been here before.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> UNIDENTIFIED MALE </SPEAKER>
He was one of the prisoners here. (on camera): For how long?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> UNIDENTIFIED MALE </SPEAKER>
Eight years.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> UNIDENTIFIED MALE </SPEAKER>
Eight, nine, eight years.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> NEELY (voice-over) </SPEAKER>
And his crime for eight years in jail? He prayed too much and was seen as
a dangerous radical. (on camera): More cells. (voice-over): But the
Mukhabarat headquarters had more horrors to reveal.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> UNIDENTIFIED MALE </SPEAKER>
And they tied their hands behind and hung them and hung them for many
days.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> NEELY </SPEAKER>
These men had relatives murdered here. So desperate are they to tell
their story that they began reenacting what they and their brothers and
friends have suffered. The hook in the ceiling is for one purpose only,
another hook in a different cell and a different form of torture. Saddam
Hussein controlled Iraq through fear, torture and execution. And it
happened here to tens of thousands of Iraqis that Saddam's secret police
deemed dangerous. This man cowered for months, crammed with 300 mothers
into a huge cell. Hamid Fatil (ph) may look like he's acting, but he was
tortured here, along with his two brothers, who were executed. This man
was here, too, with his brother.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> UNIDENTIFIED MALE </SPEAKER>
They sentenced him to death. And they sent him to Baghdad and killed. He
was hanged there, hanged.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> UNIDENTIFIED MALE </SPEAKER>
There's a prisoner under the name of Ahmed Adis Aeid (ph).
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> NEELY </SPEAKER>
They kept records of prisoners, these and their fingerprints all that's
left of them, apart from the photographs they took of exactly what they
had done. (on camera): If there is an evil center to Saddam Hussein's
regime, then it is surely here and in other places of torture. And
there's plenty here that we simply cannot show you. In this block, it was
men over here, hundreds of them, and women and children here.
(voice-over): To call all this a chamber of horrors is a cliche. And this
place is beyond cliche. The hundreds or thousands who died here who were
given no trial, no voice, cry out. On the ground, I found a book called
"The Psychology of Interrogation," as if the men who worked here for
Saddam needed a handbook. I was glad of the fresh air and glad to leave,
glad I could. No one knows yet whether the new Iraq will be the kind of
place where these children can grow up free of the fear, the horror of
torture. Bill Neely, ITV News, Basra.

<SPEAKER> WOODRUFF </SPEAKER>
Unspeakable. Journalists killed in the line of duty in Baghdad -- how
neutral are reporters in a war supposed to be? Our Jeff Greenfield
examines that question when we come back.
