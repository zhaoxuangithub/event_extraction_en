welcome back n case you're just tuning in, our top story this hour,
the discovery of suspect chemical weapons materials at an agricultural
complex in central iraq. troops from the u.s. army's 101st airborne
division went to the site on friday, finding a number of large drums
buried in bunkers. initial tests were inconclusive. the general
benjamin frankly of the 101st says today a more sophisticated test
indicated the presence of nerve and blister agents. he says that type
of test that is required sometimes shows false-positives and further
testing will be done to determine whether the materials are indeed
nonweaponized chemical agents or perhaps simply pesticides. general
frankly says it is hard to believe u.n. inspectors would have found
the facility hidden as deeply as it was near the euphrates river.
we'll are much more on this developing story coming up in a few
minutes. for the latest, though, on the air war, cnn's gary tuchman is
joining us now live from an air base not far from iraq. what's
happening there tonight, gary?
