Lovely, she refuses an autopsy which could prove how her husband died, but
then she turns around and makes accusations like this against his treatment,
and in effect, his doctors. This makes me super pissed off. The sypmtoms
of a massive allergic reaction and of a systemic infection are completely
different. Yet suddenly, she's an expert. Statements like this on shows
like Oprah, who loves to spread medical ignorance, are completely
irresponsible.

    - Christopher Reeve could have died from an allergic reaction to hospital
    - drugs, his widow has claimed.

    - The 'Superman' star, who was paralysed from the neck down after a riding
    - accident in 1995, was thought to have died from heart failure triggered by
    - an infected bedsore.

    - But, his wife Dana, who turned down a post mortem because she felt doctors
    - had done everything possible, now feels he could have had a bad reaction
    - to
    - drugs.
    - She told America's Oprah Winfrey Show: ''He was very sensitive to drugs
    - that
    - no-one else would have any sensitivity to.

    - ''There was no autopsy so we don't know for sure. We'll never know
    - absolutely.''

    - She added that her husband had 'much more living to do'. After his death,
    - she explained in a heartfelt letter to friends, family and supporters how
    - the father-of-three spent his last days doing what he loved best.

    - She said: ''He left a long phone message for Senator John Kerry, lending
    - his
    - support and encouragement.

    - He attended one of Will's (his son) hockey games, cheering as they won a
    - huge victory, bursting with pride as he was presented with the game puck.

    - ''We then watched the Yankees game and gobbled up one of his favourite
    - meals,
    - turkey tettrazini

I didn't see this as an accusation but an explanation. People can have
allergic reactions to meds they haven't reacted to before without
anyone knowing it will happen. It's the exposure to the substance that
causes the allergy to form. Like people walking through poison ivy
half their lives then suddenly having a bad reaction to it. Like the
thousands of people developing allergies to latex these days, etc. I
saw that show and didn't think she was accusing anyone of anything,
more trying to explain to people why he died so suddenly. She
mentioned several times how wonderful his Doctors and nurses and
therapists have been and mentioned them by name.

There were no accusations by her. She said there were a couple of
drugs that they had used with Chris in the past to treat his infections
with no problems, and they would use them again and he would have an
allergic reaction. It happens a lot. She said she didn't want an
autopsy because there was no blame, she knew it was just his body
shutting down. Drugs he wasn't allergic to in the past would suddenly
cause massive problems when they tried to use them for a new infection.
She had nothing but praise and gratitude for all his doctors, nurses
and care givers.

Again, a true allergic reaction and an infection have different symptoms.
She's saying all the doctors and other professionals are wrong and she is
right. Also, if any drug causes adverse effects, those effects are supposed
to be reported to the FDA so future drug users can be alerted to posible
consequences. If she truely believed what she was saying (and wan't just
talking out of her ass and probably displaying her denial about her
husband's illness) she would allow proper data to be gathered so it could be
used to help others.

Christopher Reeve had a rare disorder called Mastocytosis. Drug
sensitivities are one of the difficulties of that disorder.
Since they knew he had it, that's probably why she's not questioning this
issue. I often wondered how he was doing with all the meds because of his
illness, which developed before his paralyzing accident. It's actually a
testament to his stamina and his doctors that he was able to survive as long
as he did with this disorder complicating his care.

<SUBJECT> Re: Christopher Reeve could have died from an allergic reaction </SUBJECT>

I'm not sure about this disagreement you are speaking of between her
version and the doctors version of his cause of death. Maybe the Dr.s
had hypothesized possibilities at the time of death and in the months
since then, they may thought of other reasons I don't know. I know
about allergic reactions and meds, I've been a nurse for 20 years. And
I get a little defensive myself when a hear a layperson (although she
probably had more knowledge than most about her husband's diagnosis and
treatment) talking like an expert on TV without knowing all the
details. But as I said, I saw the show and did not get that feeling at
all that she was being in any way accusatory or blaming. She also was
not coming off as a know-it-all. This part of the interview was very
off-hand and informal feeling, more like gosh, I don't think we'll ever
know, maybe it was this, it could have been that. It was more that
she knew many people cared about her husband and wanted to know what
his last hours were like. I know not everyone is enthralled with Dana
Reeve, but she had won many people's respect. People are interested to
know how she's doing after having lost such a big part of her life, and
this really was more what the interview was about.

What I think was quite appalling from what Dana said on the Oprah show
was that the doctors wanted to pull the life support from Chris *without
her being there.* What in god's green earth would make a medical
professional say such a heartless thing to a soon-to-be-grieving widow?
That doc should lose his medical license---what a bastard.
