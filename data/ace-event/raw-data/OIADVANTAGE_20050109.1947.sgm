I can't for the life of me figure out why anyone would invest in the
airline industry. Please, someone tell me a group companies facing more
serious problems than the legacy airline carriers (Delta, US Airways,
Continental, American, Northwestern, United). High fuel costs, insane
pension obligations, and a highly paid, specialized workforce. To this
list of woes, we add a whole slew of competitors with much lower cost
structures.

I admit I've already taken advantage of the lower fares announced
last week to book a business trip but these next few years are not going
to be pretty for some of these companies. Unfortunately, the pain is not
limited to these companies. Pittsburgh, one of US Airway's hubs, built
up its airport complete with a sprawling retail complex in the terminal.
Now US Airways has reduced flights out of Pittsburgh by 28% since
January of 2004 and is in real danger of folding completely. These shiny
new airports are usually financed by long-term bonds that still have to
paid off...but not by the airlines.

This is an industry looking for a sustainable strategy. Southwest and
JetBlue were the only major airlines to earn a profit in 2004 but who
knows what will be happening in another five years. So I will thankfully
accept the low fares, bemoan the loss of food on flights, and watch
these companies parade in and out of bankruptcy.

BusinessWeek Online has some other commentary about the fare cuts
here and about US Airway's woes here .
