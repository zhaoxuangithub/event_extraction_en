According to the usually reliable CNN/Money, the "Twin Deficits" will
continue to grow . Interesting terminology... I believe they're
referring to the budget deficit and... the capital surplus? When
analyzing trade deficits, it's important to realize that the amount by
which imports exceed exports is also equal to the net amount foreign
investors have bet on the US. So the trade deficit is due to a
confluence of the pressures from US consumers (who control about 20% of
global GDP) and everybody else (excluding the non-consumption share of
US GDP, that would amount to around 75% of global GDP). Which of those
is -- probably -- going to be a more important number?

Even if we are consumers bent on gorging ourselves with imported
goods, the largest pressure on the deficit is that we're simply a better
place for investment -- higher returns on capital in developing
countries are more than mitigated by the higher political risks they
face. And what about that other deficit? It, of course, is the ominous
sum that we fund without taxes, but by borrowing funds. And about half
of those borrowings end up with the major banks in Asia. So, not to be a
heretic, but 1) We're issuing them at relatively low interest rates, 2)
Inflation is bound to pick up eventually, and so 3) Wouldn't you rather
have our deficits made up by economically nonsensical purchases by
non-US investors, rather than raising taxes in America? It's a question
of who will pay for the same spending, and all else being equal I'd be
happy for Asian central banks to pick up the tab. The Twin Deficits are
a reality, but they aren't exactly a terrifying one.
