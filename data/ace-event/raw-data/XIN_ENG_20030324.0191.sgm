BAGHDAD, March 24 (Xinhua)

Five Iraqi civilians, including a woman, were killed Monday when
their houses were hit by a missile fired by the US-led coalition
warplanes, witnesses said.

Their houses are located in Al-Azamiyah, one of the most populous
areas in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad, they said.

One house was destroyed during the strike and casualties have been
removed from the area.

The US-led coalition forces launched a new round of airstrikes on
Baghdad at 2:30 p.m. (1130GMT) on Monday.

Huge explosions were heard in different parts of Baghdad and air raid
siren sounded throughout the capital city, they said, adding that
Iraqi anti-aircraft artillery had begun to fire back.

Although the coalition leaders have repeatedly assured that every
effort would be made to minimize civilian casualties in the current
Iraq war, at least 130 Iraqi civilians have been reportedly killed
since the war started five days ago.

According to other reports reaching here, five Syrian bus passengers
were killed and 10 others were injured on Sunday morning when a US
missile hit the bus they were traveling in near the Iraqi border.

The vehicle was carrying Syrians fleeing the war in Iraq.
