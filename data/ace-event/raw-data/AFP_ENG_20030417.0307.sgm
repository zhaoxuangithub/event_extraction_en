Russia misplayed Iraq hand, but damage to US relations not fatal:

MOSCOW, April 17 (AFP)

Silence is golden -- especially when your hand is weak -- top Moscow
policy analysts said in an assessment of the fallout from Russia's
vocal opposition to what turned out to be a swift US-led campaign in
Iraq.

Several top diplomacy experts told a Kremlin-run forum that countries
like China and India that said little about the conflict before its
March 20 launch were already reaping the benefits.

Some suggested that Russian President Vladimir Putin will now be
scrambling to contain the damage to his once-budding friendship with
US President George W. Bush because he was poorly advised by his
intelligence and defense aides.

One analyst said China -- which like Russia and France wields a UN
Security Council veto but never threatened to use it to prevent the
war -- recently won its role as chief mediator between the United
States and North Korea because other regional powers' confidence in
Russia fell as a result of its Iraqi diplomacy.

"We are losing our positions in Asia because ... this failure of a
strategic triangle that (Foreign Minister Igor) Ivanov invented with
Germany and France," fumed Andrei Piontkovsky of Moscow's Center of
Strategic Studies.

Negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang on their nuclear
dispute have been set for April 23 in Bejing and are widely seen here
as a blow to Moscow efforts to stamp authority on the region by
organizing such a meeting.

Meanwhile the European "peace camp" troika finds itself in tricky
diplomatic isolation from Washington.

French President Jacques Chirac received only a reserved response
when he tried to mend fences by placing a telephone call Tuesday to
Bush.

Meanwhile German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has not spoken to Bush
since several weeks before the start of the war.

But not everyone here agreed that Moscow's diplomatic relations with
Washington had suffered as badly.

Most agreed that Russian diplomacy miscalculated and urged Putin to
quickly reassess the quality of his advisers.

"Our analysis of foreign policy is lacking and often reverts to Cold
War stereotypes," said former deputy foreign minister Anatoly
Adamishin.

"We were so proud of forming an antiwar bloc with France and Germany
-- but nations have not been forming such blocs for at least 12 years
and someone in Moscow should have understood that it was impossible
to avert this war."

"Our main goal now is to make sure that our relations with the United
States do not suffer further -- and I think this is possible."

US diplomats have hinted in recent weeks that Washington's anger with
European resistance to the campaign was focused more on Paris -- and
to a lesser extent Berlin -- than it was with Moscow.

Putin last spoke to Bush on April 5 at the US president's own
initiative. They are scheduled to meet next in the Russian leader's
native city of Saint Petersburg in late May.

"We lost nothing and won nothing -- this was not our war," said
liberal lawmaker Irina Khakamada of the Union of Rightist Forces.

"We showed the Americans that we would not give up on our position in
Iraq cheaply and we did not. We should continue sticking to our
principles."

Khakamada argued that the United States would also need Russia's help
"to make the new Iraqi government seem legitimate."

Most analysts linked Russia's opposition to a war in Iraq to fears
that it will lose oil contracts that were sealed with the now-toppled
regime of Saddam Hussein.

The floodgates of Iraqi oil are also now likely to open to world
markets and hurt Russia's budget revenues -- which are heavily
reliant on revenues from its own energy exports.

But few at the Kremlin forum suggested that Putin's own standing
among voters will be hurt by Russia's apparent diplomacy failures.

Putin will face re-election in March 2004 and analysts noted that the
war -- while opposed by most Russians -- was never turned by the
Kremlin into a matter of national security.

"I do not think that this will affect the elections unless Russia's
failure in Iraq is presented as an issue of national security -- and
has not been yet," said Viktor Kuvaldin of a research center funded
by former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev.
