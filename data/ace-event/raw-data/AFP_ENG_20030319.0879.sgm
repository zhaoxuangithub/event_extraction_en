Barry Diller resigns as CEO of Vivendi Universal Entertainment

NEW YORK, March 19 (AFP)

Media tycoon Barry Diller on Wednesday quit as chief of Vivendi
Universal Entertainment, the entertainment unit of French giant
Vivendi Universal whose future appears up for grabs.

In a statement, Diller -- who took on the "provisional" role at the
top of Vivendi's US entertainment operations in December -- said his
USA Interactive group will nonetheless remain a shareholder of
Vivendi Universal Entertainment.

"My executive role was never intended to be permanent," said Diller.
"Now that Vivendi Universal has begun a formal process in reviewing
options for its entertainment assets, it is appropriate to step aside
from any direct management responsibility."

As part of the 11-billion-dollar sale of USA Interactive's film and
television operations to the French media company in December 2001,
USA Interactive received 2.5 billion dollars in preferred shares in
Vivendi Universal Entertainment.

Diller, 60, personally received a 1.5 percent stake in the business
and had been touted as a likely candidate to run Vivendi Universal's
entertainment unit in the United States if the troubled French media
giant were broken up.

In Paris, the French media group said parent company chairman
Jean-Rene Fourtou will replace Diller as chairman and chief executive
of US unit.

Vivendi, in a statement, said that Diller had, "in full agreement
with Vivendi Universal," announced that he was "ending his temporary
assignment as CEO of Vivendi Universal Entertainment."

Vivendi Universal, the world's second-largest media group after AOL
Time Warner of the United States, has been digging out from under a
mountain of debt since the removal of expansionist boss Jean-Marie
Messier last July, largely through asset sales.

Vivendi Universal earlier this month posted a record net loss of 23.3
billion euros (25.6 billion dollars) for 2002.

Faced with debt of 35 billion euros (37 billion dollars) in June last
year -- including 19 billion from the media and telecoms division
alone -- the sprawling conglomerate has set a target of reducing its
debt by 16 billion euros by end-2004.

Speculation has been rife that troubled Vivendi has been weighing a
spinoff or sale of its US film, television and theme park operations
as part of its restructuring.

Press speculation had already suggested that Vivendi might decide to
keep its Universal Music division, while either divesting or inviting
third parties to take a minority stake in the remaining Entertainment
assets.

Earlier this month, sources told Agence France Presse financial news
unit AFX that Viacom is studying a bid for Vivendi's US entertainment
assets placing it as a serious rival squarely in the running against
oil billionaire Marvin Davis who has bid 20 billion dollars for the
operations.

While other media companies like Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Liberty Media
Corp, News Corp and General Electric Co's NBC have been mentioned as
potential bidders for the Vivendi operations, Viacom is one of the
few media companies with a balance sheet healthy enough to mount a
bid.
