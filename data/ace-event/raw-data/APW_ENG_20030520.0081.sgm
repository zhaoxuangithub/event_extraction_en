ANKARA, Turkey (AP)

An explosion in a cafe at one of the capital's busiest intersections
killed one woman and injured another Tuesday, police said.

Police were investigating the cause of the explosion in the restroom
of the multistory Crocodile Cafe in the commercial district of
Kizilay during the morning rush hour. The blast shattered walls and
windows in the building.

Police recovered the body of a woman from the debris of the restroom
and carried it away in a bodybag.

News reports suggested that the woman may have been a suicide bomber
or may have died when the bomb she was planting exploded prematurely,
but police and interior ministry officials refused to confirm the
reports.

Ankara police chief Ercument Yilmaz visited the site of the morning
blast but refused to say if a bomb had caused the explosion.

``Our colleagues are carrying out inspections,'' he said. There was
no information on the identity of the injured person.

It was not clear how many people were in the cafe at the time of the
blast.

The explosion comes a month after a bomb exploded at a McDonald's
restaurant in Istanbul, causing damage but no injuries.

Radical leftist, Kurdish and Islamic groups are active in the country
and have carried out bombings in the past.
