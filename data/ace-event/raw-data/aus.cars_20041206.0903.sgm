FFS! If that's not relevant, then what the fluck *is*?

Oh well, lets cross now to our mob of mindless drones and hear about
how good it is that this menace to society is going to be locked up
before he kills all our innocent children.

No doubt been the law in Q since it was extended from being drunk in
charge of a horse. It's also been rigorously policed for as long as I
can remember.

Note also that had the drunken fool attempted to sleep it off out of
the car he'd have been carted off to clink for a different offence.
Had he been seen consuming alcohol in public he'd have been done for
that as well.

As every Queenslander knows... if we didn't have the toughest laws
outside Islam the place would be rolling with drunks!

    - More from the Brisbane Sunday Rag.
    - Sleeping drunk 'in charge' of car
    - KAY DIBBEN chief reporter
    - 05dec04

    - A JUDGE has overturned a decision to acquit an intoxicated man who was
    - charged after he was found asleep in a parked car with the keys on his
    - lap.

    - Brisbane man Pero Spasovski last year was charged with being in charge
    - of a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, but was
    - acquitted by a magistrate.

    - Holland Park Magistrates Court was told that on July 1 last year
    - Spasovski had started drinking after buying alcohol at 8am.

    - He later went to the Manly Hotel and drank until he was asked to leave
    - at 2pm.

    - An hour later he went to his son's car in the hotel carpark, sat in
    - the driver's seat and threw the keys towards the ground.

    - But the keys landed on his lap, where police found them half an hour
    - later.

    - Spasovski said he had been waiting for a family member to come and
    - pick him up.

    - At 4.25pm he had a blood alcohol reading of .271.

    - The magistrate decided Spasovski had formed the intention not to drive
    - the car, he had not assumed physical control of the vehicle and
    - therefore was not in charge of it.

    - Spasovski, of Jindalee in Brisbane's west, who had pleaded not guilty,
    - was acquitted by the magistrate on November 24 last year after a
    - summary trial.

    - But on November 30 in Brisbane's District Court Judge John McGill set
    - aside the magistrate's decision and convicted Spasovski.

    - Judge McGill found that Spasovski was exercising physical control and
    - the fact that he did not intend to drive was irrelevant.

    - ''What matters is that he was in a position to drive the vehicle if he
    - chose to do so without first taking charge of it from some other
    - person,'' Judge McGill said.

    - He also expressed regret the law imposed the same penalties for the
    - offence of being drunk in charge of a vehicle as for driving a
    - vehicle.

    - Spasovski will be sentenced at a later date.

    - Amazing.
    - Got the bastard on a technicality. The LAW will not be denied. So says
    - McGill. J.
    - Spasovski stood a better chance staying off the hook if he'd simply
    - fired up the car and buggered off before the cops undoubtedly summoned
    - by well-meaning hotel staff arrived. Needless to say, buggering in the
    - general direction of 'off' rather in the general direction of'home'
    - would have been a good move, but probably beyond him.

This is getting beyond a joke, several times I have slept in my car after a
night out, to drive home or be picked up the next day depending on alcahol
consumption. FFS just because he sat is the drivers seat does not mean he
took control of the car. What about if he put the keys in the ignition to
turn to accessories to listen to the radio?
It the car was running fair enough, I wonder why the law is doubted so often

I thought this law was fairly well known, as long as you don't have the keys
on you are ok. Surely everyone has heard the trick of rolling the front
wheel over the keys. Chances are sleeping it off in the car won't be
terribly effective because you'll most likely be over 0.05 the next morning
anyway.

In Q he's in charge of the car from the moment he attempts to put the
key in the door lock. If he's asleep in the back seat with the keys
in his possession then he's the person in charge of the car.

The offence is being drunk in charge of a vehicle -- as distinct from
being drunk while operating a vehicle (which is a separate offence).

The way to avoid being charged is to give the keys to someone else to
unlock the door and have them hang on to the keys until you're below
.05. The standard ruse is to throw the keys under the car after
you've unlocked the door (which you can later claim was unlocked by a
person unknown).

In this case the offender escaped conviction first time around because
it was accepted that he attempted to get rid of the keys, which
supposedly landed in his lap. Judge McGill got it right as the law
stands.

Just trying to understand here... given this quote:

.

Does that mean if I'm at home alone getting pissed with the car keys on
the coffee table and the car parked outside, that I'm "in a position to
drive the vehicle if I choose to do so without first taking charge of
it from some other person" and can therefore be charged? Sure, no
reasonable cop would do that, but just strictly talking from the law
side of things.

Or does the fact that I'm on private property change that? Or what if I
were in a bar with the car outside, keys in my pocket, but I've decided
I'll take the train home later?

It would be a pretty sad state of the laws if they could come in, ask
for the owner of car rego "XXX-999" and breathalise me because I had
the keys in my pocket.

If he had a pistol in his pocket, or a case of gelignite at his feet,
I'd guess that half the people on this ng would be baying for his
hide.... Where's the fundamental difference?

Same as if the pistol is in the safe and the gelly is locked in the
shed. So long as you don't attempt to access either any charge isn't
likely to stick.

I'm reminded of when I lived in another state and the local cop
charged the town drunk in his driveway after following him home from
the pub. The drunk was acquitted on the technicality that he wasn't
on a public road when the cop arrested him. Wouldn't have happened
under Qld law -- and shouldn't have happened anywhere else. So whose
law is stupid?

Agreed, and not likely to happen in Q. You're deemed to be in charge
of the vehicle from the moment you attempt to put the key in the door
lock. Sounds fair enough to me -- especially since most Queenslanders
are well aware of the law..
