We're going to go quickly to northern Iraq now where we find CNN
correspondent Ben Wedeman. There's been some action in that area. Nick
(ph) - I mean - I'm sorry. Ben, we can make you out just barely but tell
us what you've been seeing.

<SPEAKER> BEN WEDEMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT </SPEAKER>
Yes. Judy, you're seeing us through the night scope because basically for
the last hour we've been watching as this ridge behind me in Kalak which
of course is the front line between Iraq and Kurdish (ph) forces, we've
been watching as planes, planes we can hear but cannot see, have been
bombing the ridge line behind us. Five huge explosions within the space
of less than an hour as these planes drop these massive bombs on the
Iraqi positions behind us. Not just Iraqi positions behind us, in
addition to that in the direction of Mosul as well which is a major
northern Iraqi city about 28 miles to the west of me. We've also seen
some massive blasts to the south as well so it appears that this bombing
in this area continues and we have really seen the most intense bombing
of the war in this area in the last 24 hours. Judy ...

Ben, what is your best understanding of what it is on the ground that the
coalition forces are going after there?

<SPEAKER> WEDEMAN </SPEAKER>
Well, basically on the ridge itself it is the most forward Iraqi army
positions and we've been watching them very closely for the last month
prior to the war to the outbreak of the war and basically these are the
positions that control this entire valley. Up there they have heavy
machine guns. They have mortars. They have anti-tank guns, hundreds of
men along this very long ridge that basically runs from the north to the
south. In addition to that, we know that further back behind those lines
in the direction of Mosul there is heavy artillery and tanks as well,
this according to the people here in this area, the local Kurds who have
been going across the lines for many years basically engaged in
smuggling. Now precisely what they're hitting to the south of us is
unclear but my understanding is that there are further Iraqi positions in
that direction as well. Judy ...

Ben Wedeman describing coalition hits in the area where he is, the town
of Kalak in northern Iraq. He just called in and we wanted to get this
report to you right away. Ben, very - we thank you very much for that and
we'll be coming back to you as the night - as the night wears on. We're
getting close to the bottom of the hour. We're going to get some
headlines at the hour right now with Heidi Collins.
