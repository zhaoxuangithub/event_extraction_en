we're getting late word tonight that geraldo rivera may not
be be kicked out of iraq after all. originally the central
command said the veteran fox news correspond was being
expelled because he compromised the location of the unit
he's been embedded with. now a spokesman from the central
command is saying and i'm quoting "frankly, we have bigger
and more important things to do." during a live broadcast
geraldo drew a map in the sand showing the location of the
unit in relation to baghdad. says he's not aware he's being
expelled but says if so, it is because some bitter former
colleagues of his at msnbc blew the whistle on him.

it sounds to me like some rats at my former network, nbc,
are spreading some lies about me. you know, they can't
compete fair and square on the battlefield so they're
trying to stab me in the back. it is not first time.

the central command on the other hand says rivera is being
kicked out of iraq because "he gave away the big picture
stuff." all of this now under review, whether or not
geraldo stays or goes. we'll continue to monitor that front
on the store yix another veteran war correspondent is being
fired for his controversial conduct in iraq. nbc is
terminating freelancer reporter peter arnett for statements
he made to the iraqi media. we showed you the statements
yesterday. he said the coalition's first war plan had
failed because of iraqi resistance. today he appeared on on
nbc's "today" show and said he was sorry.

i want to apologize to the american people for clearly
making a misjudgment over the weekend by giving an
interview to iraqi television. now, i said in that
interview essentially what we all know about the war, there
have been delays in implementing policy, there has been
surprises. but clearly by giving that interview to iraqi
television, i created a firestorm in the united states. and
for that i am truly sorry.

arnett had been covering the war for national geographic,
which also fired him as tv reports were given exclusively
to nbc and msnbc. late word from london that the tabloid
the daily mirror just hired peter arnett to be its
correspondent in baghdad. but the question remains did
peter arnett and geraldo rivera cross the line? or were
they within their rights as reporters? we posed that
question to michael wolf, a contributing editor for "new
york" magazine, a media columnist, an important article in
the new issue of "new york." he's joining us now live from
qatar. what do you say to the question, michael?
