From the Associated Press : The Supreme Court declined Monday to
consider whether states may offer license plates with anti-abortion
messages, leaving lower courts divided over whether the programs in a
dozen states unconstitutionally restrict dissenting views.

Without comment, justices let stand a lower court ruling that said
South Carolina's license plates, which bear the slogan "Choose Life,"
violate the First Amendment because abortion rights supporters weren't
given a similar forum to express their beliefs. Say what?? Now the First
Amendment guarantees all sides a fair voice? Where were liberals when
Ralf Nader wanted such equality? And who on Earth could possibly have a
problem with someone who paid $70 that went to a local crisis pregnancy
program for an anti-abortion license plate?

Oh that's right. The dastardly people at Planned Parenthood. Because
no one should be allowed to express an opinion that challenges the
beliefs of the American Left.
