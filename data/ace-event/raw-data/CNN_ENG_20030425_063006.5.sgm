<TURN>
two southwest airline pilots were reportedly fired for stripping down.
it wasn't part of a security check. "usa today" says the pilots were
dismissed for allegedly taking off all or most of their clothes in the
cockpit. i want to make that distinction there. the pilots are calling
the sdebt -- incident a misunderstanding and appealing their
termination.
