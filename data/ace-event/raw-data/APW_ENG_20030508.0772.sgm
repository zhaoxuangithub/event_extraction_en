MADRID, Spain (AP)

Police intercepted 33 African immigrants who came ashore Thursday in
southern Spain aboard an overcrowded boat, including several pregnant
women and other travelers suffering from hypothermia, police said.

Spanish media showed dramatic photos of police struggling to carry
women on the verge of fainting after they were found wandering
through Tarifa, Spain's windswept southern tip, Civil Guard officials
told Spanish news agencies.

Police also arrested two Moroccan men suspected of trafficking in
human beings and navigating the Zodiac boat across from Africa, Efe
said.

Twenty-six of the would-be immigrants were from sub-Saharan Africa,
six of them women, and the other seven were males from North African
countries, police said.

Red Cross officials administered first aid on the scene, and the
detainees were taken to a processing center for the government to
begin expulsion proceedings.

Tens of thousands of destitute Africans try to enter Spain illegally
each year by crossing the perilous Strait of Gibraltar to reach the
southern mainland or by sailing northwest to the Canary Islands out
in the Atlantic.

They seek a better life doing menial jobs in Spain or hope to use the
country as a stepping stone to other points in Europe. Most are
caught trying to sneak in and some die in the attempt.
