that standing ovation that sammy sosa got at wrigley field
last night. a major league baseball official is skilledded
to conduct interviews in chicago. those interviews could be
a factor as the league decides how sammy sosa will be
punished for using a court-filled bat. our gary tuchman is
live. good morning.
</TURN>
<TURN>
reporter: the cub's player this afternoon, once again,
sammy sosa will be in the lineup but he could find out as
early as today what his punishment will be and how many
games he'll be suspend for. last night when he went to play
for the first time, most of the fans on wrigley field gave
him a standing ovation. in all fairness, not all of them
totally believed sammy sosa but he's a hero here and they
want to believe sammy sosa. he hit the ground ball on the
first inning, that scored a run, but the run was taken
away. sosa was quicked out of the game after he was found
out he had a cork during the bat. he meant not to use it
during the game, but he did use it during the game. major
league baseball took 76 of his bats and x-rayed them for
cork.
</TURN>
<TURN>
those x race were negative. that was conducted by a trained
radiological technician. we believe the x-ray process was
sufficient to determine the state of those bats and we're
very confident that all of those bats were clean and had no
foreign substances within them.
</TURN>
<TURN>
it was a mistake. we're all human and we all made a
mistake. nobody's perfect in this world upon.
</TURN>
<TURN>
reporter: last night with the bat, we assumed was not cork,
sammy sosa struck out the first three times up. he did hit
a single in the ninety inning in a losing effort for the
chicago cubs. back to you.
</TURN>
<TURN>
there's a concern with the huge series there this weekend
with the yankees coming to town that sammy would be
suspended during that.
</TURN>
<TURN>
the yankees vpts been to wrigley field since the 1930s
since they played the cubs in the 1930s. sosa could get a
suspension, but he could appeal suspension. so if he wanted
to play against the yankees, he probably will be able to.

keeping an eye on us. martha stewart unfairly singled out
for prosecution or is she getting what she deserved? jim in
new york, i've des piesed martha stewart for years before
the imclone scandal, but all this prosecution does is how
bias prosecutors are when they deal with moguls who strip
the hopes of investors. ceos, sleaze walk free, market
should be free to stroll right along with them into the ceo
hall of shame. joe in michigan, prosecute, when your skit
in life is professing trust and integrity and you violate
that responsilibity to your believing public, then you
should be done.

she's a part of good
