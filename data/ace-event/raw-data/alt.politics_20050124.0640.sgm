<SUBJECT> Bush administration quietly stops destroying chemical and biological weapons </SUBJECT>

Unnoticed by anyone else, the Bush administration has quietly ditched
programs to destroy America's biggest-in-the-world stockpile of chemical
and biological weapons.

Eight places in the US are used to stockpile chemical weapons --
including blister agents, riot agents, and the dreaded nerve agents. In
these eight locations, hundreds of thousands of artillery rounds, bombs,
and rockets are stacked in both open and bunker storage, some of them
leaking their contents and all of the very deadly. Storage locations
include:
-- Anniston Army Depot, Anniston, AL
-- Rocky Mountain Arsenal, Pueblo, CO
-- Bluegrass Army Depot, Lexington, KY
-- Aberdeen Proving Grounds, MD
-- Toelle Army Depot, Toelle, UT (the granddaddy of them all)

Destruction is underway in Anniston where the Dept of Defense built and
is operating an incinerator to burn weapons located there. Plans were
underway to build destruction facilities at all other locations but now
the Bush junta has removed from its proposed defense budget for fiscal
year 2006 all but the minimum funding for these destruction projects.
Plans to destroy chemical weapons are now stopped, except for a small
test program at Toelle. Contractors (Bechtel was the main contractor)
have been told to stop all design and construction work and the
re-assign their people -- the destruction programs are dead.)

Can anyone spell "W. M. D."?

Can anyone tell me which nation in the world owns the most WMD? (Hint:
It's neither Iraq, Iran, nor North Korea -- none of the famous "Axis
of Evil.")

You don't suppose they have stopped destroying these weapons because
they plan to use them?
