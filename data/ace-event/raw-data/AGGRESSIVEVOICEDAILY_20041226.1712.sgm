Peyton Manning broke Dan Marino's season touchdown record today with
49 against the San Diego Chargers in a thrilling game that ended in
overtime. I was happy to see Manning break the record, as last week he
decided to take a knee to end the game against the Baltimore Ravens when
he could have tried to increase the lead even more by throwing a
touchdown. Manning is all class and ranks with the best quarterbacks of
all time. Marino's 48 TD record was set in 1984.

On a much sadder note, the Minister of Defense, Reggie White, died of
heart attack this morning in his home at the age of 43. White played a
total of 15 years with Philadelphia, Green Bay and Carolina. He retired
after the 2000 season as the NFL's all-time leader in sacks with 198.
The mark has since been passed by Bruce Smith.

White will surely be missed.
