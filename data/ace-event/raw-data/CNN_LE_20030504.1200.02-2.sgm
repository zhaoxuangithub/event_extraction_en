Interview With Donald Rumsfeld; Lugar, Dodd Talk About Post-War Iraq; 
Kissinger, Cohen Discuss Middle East Road Map
</HEADLINE>

<SPEAKER> BLITZER </SPEAKER>
What about the length of the U.S. military presence in Iraq, Senator
Lugar? How long do you anticipate large numbers of U.S. troops will
remain there?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> LUGAR </SPEAKER>
Well, I was heartened by what Secretary Rumsfeld told you in the last
interview, that we will have troops there as long as necessary, but no
longer than necessary. I think that's a pretty good way to state it. My
own view is that the security of the country clearly is our
responsibility presently. We are trying to pass that on to others.
Likewise, the other government's procedures, the fledgling beginnings on
democracy, and all the rest. But that's going to require an undergirding.
Now, in due course, as everybody points out, we may get help from other
countries. We may bring in NATO allies or the United Nations or other
people in the Arab world. That would be helpful. But for the moment, this
is our responsibility. And we ought not to be having large debates about
how rapidly we move out. And I was upset, in a way, to hear reports that
by the fall, three divisions out of five would be gone. I think Secretary
Rumsfeld disabused us of that today.

<SPEAKER> BLITZER </SPEAKER>
And what about you, Senator Dodd, not only the length of time, but the
cost to U.S. taxpayers? Have you been given any ballpark estimate what
this is going to cost the United States?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> DODD </SPEAKER>
No. Well, what we've heard the numbers of reconstruction running around
$100 billion. We put $2.5 billion in, in the last supplemental
appropriations bill. So it's going to be costly. These RFPs, these
seeking bids on various contracts are rather costly, and so it's going to
be expensive. And clearly the responsibility is going to fall principally
on the United States. Now, I would hope that sooner rather than later we
could see a civilian government emerge in Iraq, a democratically elected
one, that there'd be more cooperation from the international community,
on both the peacekeeping side as well as the political restructuring
that's necessary in Iraq. And to the extent we can move that along more
quickly, I think we're all going to be better off. Being the sole, or
almost the sole power there, both in terms of reconstruction and
politically, exposes us to great vulnerabilities.

<SPEAKER> BLITZER </SPEAKER>
Senator Lugar, we have to take a quick break, but before we do, I wanted
to just ask you, the U.N. role -- you say there could be a U.N. role. Do
you specifically want the United Nations to have some sort of
peacekeeping role there? And secondarily, what about countries like
France, Germany, and Russia, which opposed the Bush administration's war
plans, do you want them shut out?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> LUGAR </SPEAKER>
No, I don't want anybody shut out. And I do hope the United Nations will
play a vital role in Iraq, whether it be in peacekeeping or various other
ways, and I hope that that will occur soon. I think we really need an
internationalization of the process, for the very reasons that Senator
Dodd pointed out.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> BLITZER </SPEAKER>
All right. We're going to take that quick break. Stand by, Senators. We
have a lot more ground to cover. Senators Lugar and Dodd will be staying
with us. They'll also be taking your phone calls. LATE EDITION will
continue right after this.
