5. Death of Arafat (1) Controversial PLO leader Yasser Arafat died in
a Paris hospital last week.  Do you think Arafat's death will help or
hurt the Israeli-Palestinian peace process?  Was Arafat a good leader?
What do you think US policy should be toward Palestine now that Arafat
has died? What, if anything, should the US do to be involved in the
Middle East peace process?

Hi, this is Paul.

<SPEAKER> Rainia </SPEAKER>
Hi.  Where are you from?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
I'm in Delaware.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Rainia </SPEAKER>
Delaware.  And my name is Rainia and I'm in Eureka, California.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
Wow.  Opposite sides of the coast.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Rainia </SPEAKER>
Yeah.  Well, that's an interesting question they're asking.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
Yeah, it is, uh,  the past couple of topics have been -- more
controversial than -- the early topics -- and, uh,  well,  I'm- I'm very
opinionated. I'm happy to talk about it.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Rainia </SPEAKER>
Yeah, go right ahead.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
Well,  um,  Yasser Arafat was -- was he a good leader?  I I think -- that,
uh,  he -- he's -- pretty much -- -- or he was pretty much -- following what
he had always done, even as a young man,  uh, back in Algeria -- when-
when he led the -- terrorist attacks against the French to kick them out
of -- Algeria.  And I- I think he was doing the same thing there in
Palestine.  I- I don't think,  eh,  I don't think he really knew how
to,  uh, take on the role of- of peacemaker.  You know, I'm- I'm --
you know, I could be wrong. That's just my opinion.  But i- it seems
like that- that was always a problem for him.  Hm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Rainia </SPEAKER>
Yeah.  Um,  I'm not sure myself uh how good a leader he was. I I -- it's
hard to get the truth w- when the -- when the there's so many uh
slanted uh -- information
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Rainia </SPEAKER>
especially on the main media.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
That's true.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Rainia </SPEAKER>
I don't -- like the way -- Israel has been -- going after the Palestinians
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
Right. I- I agree. I think Ariel Sharon is a lot like Yasser Arafat.
And I -- can't understand why the two of them -- didn't see the
similarities.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Rainia </SPEAKER>
Yeah.  Um,  and they were asking -- too, of -- about the, should the ~US
be involved -- in that whole thing?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
Yeah. That- that's interesting, too, because -- cutting Yasser Arafat
out of the whole thing was- -- was really -- George Bush's decision.  I
think -- personally,  he didn't like him because he thought he was a- -- a
liar -- so he refused to -- have anything to do with him.  And, uh, th-
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Rainia </SPEAKER>
Uh, which- which Bush are you talking about?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
George ~W Bush.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Rainia </SPEAKER>
Oh, ok- yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
(())
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Rainia </SPEAKER>
Well-
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
Ev- everything kind of stopped when- -- when he became president and
all,  uh,  activity regarding -- Israel, Palestine stopped.  And Israel
pretty much could do what they wanted.  An- and you're right, it
didn't seem fair at all.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Rainia </SPEAKER>
Yeah, there're -- th- well,  the way I see it, eh, Bush, eh,  has a
right -- wing Christian, right-wing agenda.  He he's -- some -- how thinks
that -- if Israel has -- -- I'm not sure that all -- their prophecies are
-- but there's something about -- if -- they can -- get rid of the
Palestinians, that will somehow,  um,  their prophecy -- coming true and
th- and then -- somehow -- I don't -- I- we don't -- understand what on
Earth they're
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
That sounds --
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Rainia </SPEAKER>
trying to achieve with this but i- it seems like a-
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
that sounds kind of scary.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Rainia </SPEAKER>
a Christian agenda, yeah, that that -- that, uh, the end of the world,
the end times -- if, um,  Israel takes over -- Palestine that's h- some --
has something to do with the end times. It's really -- frightening the
way they talk -- and, um,  I don't think he's qualified to be involved
in this at all.  It never was right to begin with n- and,  you know,
we- we're- we're only given certain information and
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Rainia </SPEAKER>
hard to really know the whole -- real story of what's going on over
there. But I do know
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
Right.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Rainia </SPEAKER>
that what the Israelis are doing is wrong.  By going into their
territory and building these walls or building settlements -- pushing
the Palestinians out and -- Palestinians -- fight -- with rocks and -- sticks
and -- Israelis have their machine guns and bulldozers and -- I just -- t-
really unpalatable that the -- whole idea, the -- the way they're going
about -- this thing and -- I don't really feel qualified -- to say how it
should be, but -- I -- see it -- being wrong to -- hurt children and -- innocent
people.  No matter what side they're on
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
Right.
