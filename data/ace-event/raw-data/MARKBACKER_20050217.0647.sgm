would it make a noise and if it did, would anyone south of Boston
give a shit?

Wednesday, Commissioner Gary Bettman announced the cancellation of
the 2004-2005 NHL season. As if everyone didn't already know that was
the case.

Shame on the NHL and shame on the players' association for not
getting a deal done, but I put much more of the blame on the owners as
this "negotiation" came down to the wire.

I understand that the league was losing less money by not playing
than it would have by having a season this year. I also understand that
when push came to shove, the players gave in and accepted a salary cap.
Okay, the sides were about 7 million per team apart, but couldn't they
just say "alright, let's split that in half and play hockey?"

I mean Holy Christ people, two kids arguing over 10 bucks would work
it out that way. Why is this any different? The NHL's primary goal was
to get a salary cap approved by the players, and they finally did. And
what did the NHL do when that momentus event occurred?

They left the negotiating table.

Gary Bettman is a mindless troll and the professional sports
commissioner equivalent of Joe Hazelwood and this lockout / strike /
cluster fuck is the reef.

The first thing that needs to happen is that Bettman and Goodenow
(the players' association rep) need to be fired, deported, flogged,
tarred and feathered and finally forced to pay for four tickets plus a
program, four dogs, four beers, and two cokes and parking to a game at
an NHL arena for every day of the next season so they understand what
the fans go thru to see a hockey game.

Then, all current contracts need to be voided by the end of the
season in 2006. That means no team would own any player, and the owners
would be free to sign whomever they'd like using the "fiscal restraint"
they all droned on and on about all year. That way, they'd only pay as
much as they could afford...right?

Wrong.

Those douchebags would end up overspending like every professional
sports owner because they can't control themselves. If Mr. Iginla or
Heatley were free agents, for example, owners would bid each other out
of their minds, then they'd be left with not enough to get a competetive
team.

While the business model in the NHL was certainly flawed and the
owners needed help, they really needed help to protect them from
themselves. And the fact is that without that help, the owners would
follow the same path that got them where they are right now anyway.

The biggest issue is this, however. Very few people give one hot shit
whether the NHL plays another game ever, let alone this season or the
next one. For every crying Canuck there are 1,000 or more others who say
"No hockey? Huh...didn't even notice."

And the last television network interested in carrying hockey (ESPN)
may opt out of televising the NHL next season, meaning that all of the
teams would be in HUGE trouble, because no TV = no league. Period.
Atlanta lost the Flames 25 years ago because, despite full houses every
night, it's TV revenue that pays the freight and the Flames had no tv
contract. Imagine an entire league with no TV contract. Hell, Major
League Soccer and the WNBA DO have a tv contract and no one gives a shit
about them.

I'll say this for the NHL, when they screw up, they screw up huge.

Congrats guys. You will forever be known as the generation that
killed professional hockey in North America. That'll look GREAT on your
resumes.
