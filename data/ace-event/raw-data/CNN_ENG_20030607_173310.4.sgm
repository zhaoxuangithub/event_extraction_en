now back to "people in the news."
</TURN>
<TURN>
good to be [bleep] king.
</TURN>
<TURN>
reporter: with the success of a new television show and
last year's oz-fest tour ready to kick off, things were
looking great for ozzy osbourne. he was sober. he was rich
and surrounded by a family who loved him but once again,
ozzy's high would hit a low. that july, sharon osbourne,
ozzy's long time manager, wife and best friend, announced
to the world that she'd been diagnosed with colon cancer.
</TURN>
<TURN>
every fiber of ozzy was shaken. he had to be sedated for a
while.
</TURN>
<TURN>
reporter: sharon would have to undergo rounds of
chemotherapy all summer. ozzy took time off from oz-fest to
tend to his wife. ever the rock, sharon faced cancer head
on.
</TURN>
<TURN>
when you go in there and people so much worse than me, and
it's like, how lucky am i have a great support system.
</TURN>
<TURN>
reporter: even with sharon trying to make things as easy as
possible on her husband, he was still a mess. his struggle
with sobriety would be tested again.
</TURN>
<TURN>
ozzy's not doing too good right now.
</TURN>
<TURN>
drinking?
</TURN>
<TURN>
drinking and he's very delicate. he's, like, dealing with
it the best he can.
</TURN>
<TURN>
reporter: despite sharon's illness, it's business as usual
for the family, though pushed back, filming commenced last
fall on a second season of "the osbournes."
</TURN>
<TURN>
some days when i'm feeling bad, i say i can't do this
anymore, and then you wake up and see the crew, and then,
you know, you snap out of it.
</TURN>
<TURN>
reporter: the larger question loomed. how could comedy come
out of chemotherapy treatments?
</TURN>
<TURN>
sharon is dealing with the diagnosis and illness but what's
interesting is humor is the same.
</TURN>
<TURN>
reporter: and the humor did remain the same. the show came
back with a vengeance last fall chronicling ozzy and sharon
dealing with cancer and the kids hoping -- coping with
new-found celebrity and one of the top rated shows, ratings
for the second season slid.
</TURN>
<TURN>
i'm not banking my whole life on bringing, you know, number
one rated show.
</TURN>
<TURN>
having a nervous break down.
</TURN>
<TURN>
the bubble will burst.
</TURN>
<TURN>
reporter: this year, more ups and downs. sharon announced
in april that the cancer was in remission. but just weeks
after that announcement, son jack entered drug and alcohol
rehabilitation in california. his family said that his
party life style caught up with him. now, with a third
season set to start, will ozzy's role as a family man
change the image in the annuls of heavy metal mad man?
</TURN>
<TURN>
i think ozzy's the guy that hit a head of a bat. you know?
crazy, drug taking, hard drinking, hard living rock n
roller. i think what the show does is also show that you
might be those things, but also might be a pretty great
dad, too.
</TURN>
<TURN>
i wouldn't be here now if it wasn't for my wife. i always
loved my wife but sometimes i don't like her and sometimes
she doesn't like me but we love each other. i hate these
people that go, we've been married for 56 years and never
had a bad word. they must have been living in a different
planet.
</TURN>
<TURN>
reporter: ozzy osbourne's life filled with incredible highs
crashing into devastating lows. a manic life, grounded in
family values.
</TURN>
<TURN>
ozzy's not going to like me saying this, but he's a very
tender, gentle man. this is a guy whose world revolves not
so much around music as around his wife.
</TURN>
<TURN>
rock 'n roll!
</TURN>
<TURN>
part of the legacy of ozzy osbourne is a cautionary tale.
it's also, you know, tale that includes family love, you
know, and a lot of good things.
</TURN>
<TURN>
we have had it.
</TURN>
<TURN>
reporter: it's a tale that continues to unfold. no telling
how long the osbourne phenomenon may last but the family's
loyal following will always be screaming for more.
</TURN>
<TURN>
stop screaming!
</TURN>
<TURN>
reporter: and so will ozzy.
</TURN>
<TURN>
sharon!
</TURN>
<TURN>
despite problems
