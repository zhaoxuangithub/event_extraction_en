york. carrie. a you said it, renay. the dow was in negative
territory much of the day. a couple stocks losing ground,
coca cola, down 6.1%. they did okay on the profit quarter,
but the taste vowel came in late for all the regions that's
why it is selling off today. you can see the nasdaq pretty
nice gains holding steady throughout the day, mainly due to
intel and microsoft. they're in flu enshall on thed? hey

quarter. they both had good things to say going forward
upping or reiterating 2003 guidance. good solid reports.
motor row la. cutting another 3,000 jobs by the end of the
year. profits for the end of the year did see profit as
well. motorola and texas instruments both in the chips base
as well swinging to profits as well, with sales up 20%.
finally amr, the stock gained 15% yesterday, today's shares
up another sen.8%. the flight attendants have until 6:00
today to ratify labor concessions. the pilots union and
ground crew did so yesterday. the flight attendants came in
with a close vote rejecting these concessions so the ceo
has extended the deadline today, if they don't ratify these
agreements, amr will have to file for bankruptcy. investors
are betting they will agree, 16.8% to the upside is
certainly a vote of confidence. back to you, guys.
