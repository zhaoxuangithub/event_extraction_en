<SUBJECT> Jennifer Tilly was born Jennifer Chan. Why is this so???? </SUBJECT>

I was researching Meg Tilly on the internet and thus accidentally found out
that Jennifer Tilly was born Jennifer Chan. This is documented in a few web
sites. I used to wonder if Meg Tilly was part chinese because of her eyes, so
now I wonder more. Well, are they??????????

How tall is Meg Tilly? I can't find any web sites that state how tall she
is!!!!

One bit of trivia that has been asked a LOT concerns Meg's 'ethnicity'. Well,
for the longest time this was a topic she and her sister Jennifer seemed to
avoid, but a few months back, Jennifer announced to the world that their father
is Chinese. So, that should answer all of THOSE questions. Personally it has
never made much difference to me - she is who and what she is! Oh..! And for
all of you who have been asking how TALL she is - an article about Meg in the
January 1984 issue of 'Seventeen' magazine states she is 5 ft 6 inches.

    - just plain homely while Meg is cute.

Oh my goodness... I never even realized there were two of them till now!
The Tilly actress I *knew* just had this way of sometimes looking really
good, sometimes like a bloated alcoholic sexpot who'd spent way too much
time on the barstool. Mystery solved!

That was Meg. There's a third sister too, not in show biz, the
youngest of the 3 I think, forget her name.

Well, Jennifer is certainly far sexier than Meg. Meg is sorta like the
female Steve Buschemi. Homely, but a good actor and well respected. Jennifer
is still smokin' hot at 46.
