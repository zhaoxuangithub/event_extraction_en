11. Holiday Traditions: The holiday season is right around the
corner. Who do you like to celebrate with during the holidays? Do you go
to a lot of parties with friends, neighbors, co-workers or family
members? Are there people you see during the holidays that you don't see
during the rest of the year? Do you travel to meet up with family or
friends during the holidays? Where do you go and who do you visit?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ryan </SPEAKER>
Hello, my name's Ryan.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Deirdre </SPEAKER>
Ryan,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ryan </SPEAKER>
Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Deirdre </SPEAKER>
my name is Deirdre.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ryan </SPEAKER>
Hi, Deirdre.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Deirdre </SPEAKER>
So, what do you do for the holidays? Do you celebrate the holidays? Is
it religious for you, or just the holiday season?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ryan </SPEAKER>
It's religious for us.  Um, Christmas,  not Hanukkah or anything like
that.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Deirdre </SPEAKER>
Uh-huh, so yo- you have a church service?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ryan </SPEAKER>
Um, actually, usually we're out of town so we don't attend our church.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Deirdre </SPEAKER>
So you go with, um,  family, friends?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ryan </SPEAKER>
Family, yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Deirdre </SPEAKER>
Family?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ryan </SPEAKER>
It's almost always my grandma.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Deirdre </SPEAKER>
Your gran- you go to your grandma's house.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ryan </SPEAKER>
Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Deirdre </SPEAKER>
Yeah, that's what we do.  Every year,  uh, but I don't always attend.
Uh, my family -- celebrates the sun shining. They're always together.
So, uh, it's not particularly special at Christmas -- because they see
each other every other weekend.  But, still,  uh, they go to, uh,
grandmother's -- every Christmas.  A particular person's house every
holiday season.  You know, whether it's Christmas or -- Thanksgiving or
Mother's Day or Easter,  it just alternates it- you know, each- uh, a
particular person's house is- is how they do it.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ryan </SPEAKER>
Oh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Deirdre </SPEAKER>
I just don't always attend. Just- -- I don't know, it's- -- there's just
so much of my family I can take during one year, you know, but-
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ryan </SPEAKER>
Well, um, since they see each other so much, is there anything that
does make it special?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Deirdre </SPEAKER>
Well,  I guess they seem to think it's just special because -- everyone
comes. I- I- it's- -- it's just,  I don't know, old. Y- you know, it's-
it's not- -- it's not special to me because they do it all the time. You
know, special would make it,  I only see you once a year.  It's just
not- it's just not special if I see you every other month.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ryan </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Deirdre </SPEAKER>
You know, it's just not. I mean, you know, not like, you're seeing
your mother -- or your sister, maybe your brothers, you know, you- you
might- you may see them all the time,  but when you see your aunts and
uncles and all your cousins -- all the time,  where's the break here?
But, you know, they like- I don't particularly care for it, but they
like it.  I did attend Thanksgiving and
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ryan </SPEAKER>
Huh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Deirdre </SPEAKER>
that was nice.  Um,  uh, it was- it was a good day.  Uh, but, you
know, we- we -- spend all day together.  It's not like you just go and
eat dinner a couple of hours and go home.  You go and you stay twelve
hours -- because most of my relatives live within thirty minutes of each
other,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ryan </SPEAKER>
((Ye-))
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Deirdre </SPEAKER>
so it's easy.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ryan </SPEAKER>
Oh, wow.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Deirdre </SPEAKER>
Yeah.  It's easy just to go to someone's house.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ryan </SPEAKER>
Well, sounds a lot like my mom's side of the family because they're
all in one city except for
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Deirdre </SPEAKER>
And-
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ryan </SPEAKER>
except for her and, uh,  us.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Deirdre </SPEAKER>
Well, would you rather be with everyone else or do you like it -- away.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ryan </SPEAKER>
I think I would rather be, but then again -- I talk to my cousin and I'm
always asking her how my other cousins are doing and -- she hardly knows
because she has- hardly sees them every day.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Deirdre </SPEAKER>
Oh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ryan </SPEAKER>
So I don't think it'd make a big difference.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Deirdre </SPEAKER>
For you, yeah, well.  I don't ((see them or-)) you know, by choice
and, you know, relatives -- are particular people, you know, but not
particular, peculiar people, let's put it that way.  It's just -- funny
to me who you end up with, you know,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ryan </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Deirdre </SPEAKER>
as your relative, you know. You think, eh, you are my rela- you got to
be kidding me. Wh- -- what happened here but, uh, it's fun, uh. Now, I'm
not so big on Christi- I mean, I was- I was raised Christian,  uh,
but, uh,  and I didn't put too much, you know, in my house with my
kids -- but my daught-, she's just -- you know, she get's into it. She's
really sentimental. She's gets into the holiday spirit and wants
every light, you know, in the city on our house and,  you know, tree
in her room, that kind of thing.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ryan </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Deirdre </SPEAKER>
You know, I- I indulge her, you know.  But I don't really get too much
into it. You know, the- -- all the, um,  trimmings, I suppose,  of the
holiday season.  Uh, but I like, you know, gift giving and -- just, uh,
sharing things and just having fun. Just,  uh,  just don't over do it.
But I would prefer, though, um,  a service, a spiritual service -- to
uh, family's just always together, they're always together. Now if
there was a spiritual service then, yeah, see that would be really
special to me.  If everybody- now wh- eh, eh, now years ago, and of
course I'm not giving away my age but trust me, I'm older,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ryan </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Deirdre </SPEAKER>
eh, I used to, um,  celebrate it with my grandmother -- and we'd always
have a midnight service at church.  Now, I enjoyed that.  Gosh that
was so many years a-
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ryan </SPEAKER>
Wow, a midnight service, like, um, Christmas Eve?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Deirdre </SPEAKER>
Yeah. Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ryan </SPEAKER>
Wow.
