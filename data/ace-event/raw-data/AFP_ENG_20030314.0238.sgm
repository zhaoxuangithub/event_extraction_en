Stalemate at the Security Council; Washington warns it may bypass UN

UNITED NATIONS, March 14 (AFP)

Efforts were to continue at the United Nations Friday to find a
breakthrough in the diplomatic stalemate on Iraq, with Washington
warning it could bypass the Security Council and go to war alone.

With marathon talks at the top world body failing late Thursday to
reconcile French and Russian opposition to US-British war plans, the
United States upped its military presence, deploying more
missile-firing warships to the Red Sea.

Six non-permanent members of the Security Council considered to be in
the middle ground between the fiercely pro- and anti-war camps, were
working on new proposals to break the deadlock, France's ambassador
to the UN said.

"The six are now working on a paper and we will see the outcome of
that consultation, maybe tomorrow (Friday)" Jean-Marc de La Sabliere
told reporters.

Iraq was due to present a 30-page report on biological weapons it
said it destroyed in 1991, according to diplomatic sources in
Baghdad, who said a second batch of documents on anthrax would follow
in the next few days.

Amid talk of delaying or even shelving a US-British resolution giving
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein until Monday to disarm or face war,
oil prices in Asia pulled back, shares rose and the US dollar eased.

British efforts to provide a way out of the diplomatic mire at the
United Nations ended without agreement late Thursday, but with
London's ambassador to the UN, Jeremy Greenstock, saying he expected
talks to go on into the weekend.

His US counterpart, John Negroponte, said: "I can't say we are much
farther along today than we were yesterday," after hours of talks on
six British benchmarks to test Iraq's compliance with council
demands.

The tests were designed to sway six uncommitted council members
behind a draft resolution which would declare that Iraq has missed
its last chance to disarm peacefully unless the council decides
otherwise by Monday.

The two allies would not push for a vote Friday on the draft
resolution, diplomats at the United Nations said, while US Secretary
of State Colin Powell hinted that Washington would consider not even
putting the text to a vote.

"We are still talking to the members of the council with respect to
coalescing around a position that wouldn't draw a veto, but the
options remain: go for a vote and see what members say, or not go for
a vote," Powell said.

"We will be examining them today, tomorrow and into the weekend," he
said late Thursday.

Diplomatic wrangling has centred around the French and Russian
refusal to put their names to any resolution allowing the United
States to unleash its military might against Iraq before weapons
inspections have run their course.

France has provoked Washington's ire in its steadfast insistence that
it will veto any resolution paving the way for war, even rejecting
the British proposals for concrete tests before Baghdad had done so.

France's threat to cast its veto was only making war more likely,
British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said.

"Unfortunately they appear to have made the decision not to enforce
(UN resolution) 1441," Straw told Britain's The Guardian newspaper.
"That renders it less likely that we get a peaceful outcome."

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Yury Fedotov said the US decision to
drop demands for a Security Council vote this week on war with Iraq
showed the resolution had not won enough support.

He rejected the British proposals, saying: "The British proposals on
Iraq are not constructive and do not resolve the key problem, the
prevention of a military scenario involving Baghdad," the Interfax
news agency reported.

He repeated that Moscow would not back a resolution that authorised
an attack against Iraq: "It is not necessary now to adopt any new
resolution on Iraq, especially resolutions which lead to war."

His comments were echoed by the German ambassador to the UN, Gunter
Pleuger, who said: "There is no majority support for the British
proposal."

In Germany, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said that weapons inspectors
had to be allowed to continue their work.

"Together with our friends in France, with Russia, China and the
majority of the security council we are confident the disarmament of
Iraq can be achieved through peaceful means," Schroeder said.

The British-US proposal needs nine votes to pass through the
15-member Security Council -- a feat looking increasingly unlikely
with France and Russia vowing to veto the resolution and Syria, China
and Germany all opposing.

The United States meanwhile deployed its B-2 stealth bombers to
positions closer to Iraq and ordered as many as 15 warships capable
of firing Tomahawk cruise missiles to the Red Sea from the
Mediterranean, US officials said.
