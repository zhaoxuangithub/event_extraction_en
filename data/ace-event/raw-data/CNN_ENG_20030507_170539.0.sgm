arthritis. * * we liberated the people of iraq from a brutal
dictatorship. [translator speaking] we brought greater security to
people of all nations. i want to thank the president for spain's
diplomatic support before the conflict. [translator speaking] and for
the use of spanish air space and bases as the war grew closer.
[translator speaking] i also offer my condolences to the family and
friends of the two members of the spanish media who lost their lives
while covering the hostilities. [translator speaking] both spain and
the united states are committed to a stable, democratic and peaceful
future for the people of iraq. [translator speaking] spain has shown
that commitment by sending engineering and medical units to help the
people of iraq. [translator speaking] and i thank you for that help.
[translator speaking] today, i have moved to ease sanctions imposed by
the united states against iraq's old government. [translator speaking]
first based on the authority recently given to me by congress i'm
suspending the iraq's sanctions act, which restricts the export of
certain commitment necessary for iraq's reconstruction. [translator
speaking] secondly,'m directing the secretary to relax sanctions on
american countries and citizens conducting business in iraq that
contributed to humanitarian reconstruction. [translator speaking]
soon, at the u.n. security council, the united states, great britain
and spain will introduce a new resolution to lift the sanctions
imposed by the united nations. [translator speaking] the regime that
the sanctions were directed against no longer rules iraq. [translator
speaking] and no country in good conscience can support using
sanctions to hold back the hopes of the iraqi people. [trance lay or
the speaking] across the globe, spain and america will continue as
strong allys in the war against terror. [translator speaking] today,
the united states took steps to cut off financing for the organization
because of its ties to the eta. [translator speaking] we believe that
the people of spain like everywhere have a right to live free from
terror. [translator speaking] we'll also work for a better world
beyond the war on terror. [translator speaking] we're committed to
expanding trade which builds prosperity on both sides of the atlantic.
[translator speaking] we'll work together to address global poverty in
the terrible diseases such as hiv aids. [translator speaking] spain
and the united states will stand on the side of people everywhere
striving for greater freedom, tolerance and opportunity. [translator
speaking] we're determined to help build peace between the israelis
and the palestinians. [translator speaking] last week's confirmation
of mazen permitted the road map for peace, developed with russia, the
european union and the united states. [translator speaking] spain and
the united states are determined to take advantage of this moment of
opportunity for peace. [translator speaking] i'm grateful for the wise
council and friendship of jose maria aznar. [translator speaking]
