</TURN>
<TURN>

Hi, my name is Lynn.

Oh, how are you?

<SPEAKER> Dave </SPEAKER>
Pretty good.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Lynn </SPEAKER>
Oh, so the topic is elections.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Dave </SPEAKER>
Right.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Lynn </SPEAKER>
Um, I did vote
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Dave </SPEAKER>
I did also.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Lynn </SPEAKER>
and I voted for, uh,  not Bush.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Dave </SPEAKER>
Well, I guess, uh, you voted for Kerry then, right.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Lynn </SPEAKER>
Yes, I did.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Dave </SPEAKER>
Yeah, are you in a blue or a red state?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Lynn </SPEAKER>
I'm sorry?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Dave </SPEAKER>
A blue or a red state?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Lynn </SPEAKER>
I'm from Missouri -- I'm in Missouri.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Dave </SPEAKER>
Missouri.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Lynn </SPEAKER>
Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Dave </SPEAKER>
I forget which is which.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Lynn </SPEAKER>
Well I b- really don't even look at it like that, but I should know
that, shouldn't I?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Dave </SPEAKER>
Yeah, I'm in Indiana -- so, uh,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Lynn </SPEAKER>
And we were kind of split in the middle I think so I don't know.
Maybe we're half blue and half red.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Dave </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Lynn </SPEAKER>
So, you voted for Bush, then?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Dave </SPEAKER>
No, I I voted for Kerry.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Lynn </SPEAKER>
Oh, you did, too.  Oh, okay.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Dave </SPEAKER>
But, uh, I live in a kind of a staunchly -- Republican state.  So, there
was really no way for my vote to make a difference.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Lynn </SPEAKER>
Which, you know, I I just think the electoral votes -- I don't know
what's wrong with everybody just taking, you know, a head count and
voting
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Dave </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Lynn </SPEAKER>
and doing away with the *electorials.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Dave </SPEAKER>
Well, you know, you're you're talking about,  um,  the Constitution
there, so,  I mean, you know, it takes a lot to change the
Constitution.  I know they're also -- I've been reading some articles
lately about they're -- thinking about, uh,  uh,  why should only a
native born person be allowed to, uh, be President.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Lynn </SPEAKER>
Oh, I know. That is kind of interesting to -- think that,  I mean, I
think it'll be a long time before -- they would change that.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Dave </SPEAKER>
Yeah, but, uh, just in the last uh, well, actually just in the last
month or so I -- is really the only time I've ever heard anybody even
even talk about it.  And, uh,  well, I I -- I did read a a column today
by,  uh,  a Hispanic fellow and, uh,  he wasn't native born, he was
from Cuba,  and, uh,  he stated that, uh,  we he was in the fifth
grade and and, uh,  uh, he was taking -- no, I guess he was in middle
school and he was taking a civics class and and it was pointed out to
him that, you know, he could never become President.  And he stated at
that time, you know, he said, well, okay I can't be President I'll
never, you know, get involved in politics.  So,  you know, he kind of
thought that was unfair.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Lynn </SPEAKER>
Well, you know, in one sense it is but then, I mean -- well, my
grandparents came over, Ellis Island and everything, but when I think
about, you know, a foreign person or maybe born in another country and
coming here it doe- it doesn't seem right in one sense for -- for them
to be able to be President of this country.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Dave </SPEAKER>
Right.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Lynn </SPEAKER>
But -- it kind of falls like -- I mean I've been on the internet lately
and I've ran across these really weird websites -- and I'm not a fanatic
or anything but they're all about the -- the new world, one world
government and things like that, you know,  and to me it's just
another point in that direction. Maybe eventually, you know,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Dave </SPEAKER>
Uh-huh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Lynn </SPEAKER>
that won't make a you know, twenty or thirty, forty, fifty years down
the road.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Dave </SPEAKER>
Right, eh, so what do you think about George Bush?  Eh, are
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Lynn </SPEAKER>
I I think he's a phony. I mean, that's another thing they were talking
about that he is with the Skull and Bones from I think he went to
Yale,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Dave </SPEAKER>
Right.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Lynn </SPEAKER>
and so was his father and and Clinton was, too, and and people
actually that +alumina
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Dave </SPEAKER>
And Kerry was a Skull and Bones, also.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Lynn </SPEAKER>
Also, yeah, and then they -- I don't know what else they're called but
they're saying, like, they were like Satan people, Satan worshipers
and,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Dave </SPEAKER>
Oh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Lynn </SPEAKER>
you know, and you don't know what to believe. I watched a show on
channel nine about Bush and him being religious,  spiritual, of
course, but also religious when his father wasn't,  and -- I don't know.
You know, you hea- I I think it's all a bunch of lies, and -- I I don't
I'm not crazy about Bush. There're some things about him, you know,
the fact that he does act spiritual and things like that, I like that,
I think that's what got him in office but,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Dave </SPEAKER>
Uh-huh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Lynn </SPEAKER>
um
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Dave </SPEAKER>
Well what do you think of him as a man? Do you think he's, uh, a good
man or do you think he's got -- any good qualities, or
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Lynn </SPEAKER>
Uh, I -- you know, I want to say that he probably is but then I look at
the things like where he wants -- the things he's done. I think that
people are poorer.  I mean,  I just think the um, we're so much more
in debt. I just don't think he -- -- But as far as the man himself, I
again, I don't know.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Dave </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Lynn </SPEAKER>
What do you think of him?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Dave </SPEAKER>
Well, I I think I think his dad was a better man than he is.  You
know,  to me,  you know, I'm kind of in the same boat you're in.  I
think he was just he's kind of the sizzle, you know, he's not the
steak.  I think he was just sold to the American people.
