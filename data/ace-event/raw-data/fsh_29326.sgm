Hi. Good evening.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Jean </SPEAKER>
Hello.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mohammed </SPEAKER>
How're you doing?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Jean </SPEAKER>
Good evening. My name is Jean, and I'm in Arizona.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mohammed </SPEAKER>
Oh, from Arizona, Jean. How are you doing?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Jean </SPEAKER>
I'm fine, thank you. And what's your name?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mohammed </SPEAKER>
Ah, this is Mohammed, calling from New York.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Jean </SPEAKER>
Mohammed, calling from New York. Glad to meet you.  Well, the topic is
interesting, but they've been having this one for three days. I don't
know why they're so obsessed with it.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mohammed </SPEAKER>
Seems like it's a weekend,  or they want to get as much as they can
feedback from people.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Jean </SPEAKER>
I guess so, Yes.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mohammed </SPEAKER>
And so what do you think was-
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Jean </SPEAKER>
I I didn't actually -- watch the trial very much, uh th- in fact, I
didn't watch the trial at all.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mohammed </SPEAKER>
Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Jean </SPEAKER>
I read about it in the newspaper and things like that.  Um,  I do
think from all the, uh, things that I have heard that he -- had to be
guilty with all the evidence that they had, but um,  I don't really
know why, uh,  if everybody was so, sort of, obsessed about it when
we've got so much other -- things going on in the world that, uh, seem
to me much more important, but um.  Perhaps it was because he seemed,
uh, a very human kind of person and, and you cou- you couldn't really
understand why he would want to do something about that. I- I think
his motive must have been to be with his new girlfriend, but uh- -- kill
his own first child that way is extraordinary.  What do you think?
Mohamed?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mohammed </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Jean </SPEAKER>
And what do you- What do you think about it?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mohammed </SPEAKER>
Being very frankly, I was not,  uh, following the case at all even uh
uh television, or uh reading, but from what I can observe,that it
seems, eh, it has been talking -- -- taking too long time.  Like one
year almost, now.  It was-
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Jean </SPEAKER>
When you what?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mohammed </SPEAKER>
It was -- taking so much time. Long time.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Jean </SPEAKER>
Yes.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mohammed </SPEAKER>
The case is almost one year.  Like last,  uh, Christmas if I'm not,
uh, recalling my memory.  So for one year, it's really a good time.
Hu- So I'm asking myself why it took such a long
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Jean </SPEAKER>
Hm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mohammed </SPEAKER>
It may be because -- it's quite important,  or so there is so many
everything's, I mean,  it's, it's a really different case.  But,  the
quo- the nice quotient is about the media.  But the media have biased
in this,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Jean </SPEAKER>
Yes.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mohammed </SPEAKER>
or not?  I believe that media is a very good, uh,  I mean, uh,  way
to give us all the opportunity to understand and see.  I mean without
the media,  you and I, how we will be knowing?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Jean </SPEAKER>
No, exactly.  Do you think they were biased in in -- favor of him, or in
favor
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mohammed </SPEAKER>
I- -- No, I don't think so.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Jean </SPEAKER>
No, I didn't think so either from what I heard.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mohammed </SPEAKER>
Maybe -- sometimes in- in- in- in other issues they- they may be biased,
but in this issue they were just -- covering what's happening,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Jean </SPEAKER>
Yes.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mohammed </SPEAKER>
and, uh, they give us the picture. It was a camera -- to give you the
view.  I don't think they were biased in this case here.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Jean </SPEAKER>
Yes.  No.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mohammed </SPEAKER>
And, uh,  what do you think will happen next?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Jean </SPEAKER>
Well, uh they're coming up to the sentencing, and I heard yesterday or
read in the newspaper or something that his brother -- I guess it was
on the television.  In the news, his brother was appealing -- for them
to to sentence him to -- to prison for life rather than the death
penalty, because -- he said he's a very good listener and he cares about
people, and and he might be able to help a lot of people in prison.  I
don't know whether that is true or not. I know that he had done a lot
of volunteer things before, and that was the one things that made me
wonder there was any possible chance that it could have been somebody
else who did it.  I think given such as I have heard, even though like
you, I did not follow the case day by day or anything like that,  I
don't quite see how he could not be guilty if they've got so much that
appears to point to him.  And what would be the motive for anybody
trying to -- to get him if it wasn't
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mohammed </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
