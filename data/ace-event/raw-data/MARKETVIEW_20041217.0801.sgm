Gazprom, the main Russian gas company, has been denied a $10 billion
credit line due to the political situation in Russia. The company
intended to use the cash to pay an artificially low price for Yukos
assets (hence that firm's bankruptcy filing a few days ago -- you know
it's bad when you have to use US courts to protect your own assets from
appropriation by your home country). It's starting to look like Putin's
goal is a sort of judicial nationalization -- taking control of key
assets through court, rather than executive, fiat. But the markets have
caught on, and Russia may be deprived of the capital it needs to grow.
Don't expect any of the Russian leadership to reverse course; given the
current trends there, they'll just Blame the West when their screwy plan
screws them over.
