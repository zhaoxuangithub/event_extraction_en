3. Bush Cabinet President Bush has just been elected to another term
in office, and he has already started to appoint new people to his
political cabinet as current members like Colin Powell and John
Ashcroft resign.  Who would you like to see appointed to his cabinet
next term?  Who are they, and why do you think they should be
appointed? If you were president, which national figures would you
appoint to your cabinet and why?  What new cabinet positions would you
create and who would fill them?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
I I'm sorry to see Colin Powell leave, leaving. I think he's probably
one of the most -- diplomatic -- um, men that I've seen in politics.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
So do I.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
He he's very honest, he's very strong in his beliefs, and I'm sorry to
see him go.  I'm also sorry to see Tom Ridge resigning.  Um
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
I am too, and you know what, I don't where, do you know anything about
his background? I don't know where he came from.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
he's the Governor of, he was the Governor of Pennsylvania.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
Oh, that's right. Okay.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
And um after uh
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
Now I remember.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
he before nine eleven, he was -- he was on an advisory committal --
committee -- to the Gover- to the President I guess,  besides him
running uh Pennsylvania, and then after nine eleven they appointed him
you know, head of Homeland Security, and then created the
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
Uh-huh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
uh Secretary's position for him,  or for someone, but him being the
person at that time. I just think that
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
Yeah.  Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
it's so soon -- since nine eleven, and he has been creating his own
job, i- in essence, because it's such a new position.  But, I think
it's -- it would've been -- better to have one person -- like continuing
that.  However,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
I do too. I I do too. I hate to I hate to change -- change horses there
so quickly.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
Uh I I I'd that -- that -- job uh uh needs continuity -- for a while.
Anyhow.  You know, I m- I mean, at least until they get
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
settled on what the job really is.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Yeah, well uh maybe maybe on one hand -- somebody new will bring a new
perspective to it, which would -- be helpful, but I still think that
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
Uh yeah
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
the people that are up for it -- there's some p-
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
Yeah, but if it's if the perspective is too new, you know, that's not
going to be a good thing, because uh wholesale changes is not what
they need to do.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
yeah.  Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
Uh uh no matter who takes it over. They need to they need to -- think
long and hard before they start making changes.  Because if they make
one wrong one, you know, it
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
But there are there are a couple women up for -- the position as well as
um you know, a few men that are up for the position.  And I don't know
anything about the women that are up for the position. Um -- one -- two of
the men are from New York, one is a Head of -- the the -- who was there at
nine eleven. He was the Chief of Police.  Or the Commissioner -- of of
police I guess.  Uh who was with Giuliani throughout the whole thing.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
Uh-huh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Um they're also thinking about Giuliani, so -- I mean, I think they have
some qualified candidates.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
However,  I think -- with it's Homeland Security, which means it can't
just be New York, which is where of course, their focus is going to
be.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
Sure.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Having -- you know, been there, and through that.  So, as long as they
don't have blinders on,  you know,  I would be okay with that, but
they've got to look, obviously -- at ports -- nuclear power plants, you
know, and oth- other areas where we are vulnerable.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
Yeah.  Yeah, and you know what's really scary to me? I I don't I've
never seen it mentioned, I've never -- but -- but if they really wanted to
to I don't know uh uh uh if they if they really wanted to put -- fear in
the American people,  uh -- I know it would work with me,  is if they
say just uh if if -- I say they, Bin Laden, or who whoever -- uh -- uh is
running that team now, uh were to -- were to just pick a small -- Mid-
American town,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
uh and just wipe it out,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Yeah, no, and I I thi- I think that's a great fear.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
you know, and there are a lot of ways -- there are a lot of ways to do
that. I mean, I mean, it wouldn't take a nuclear weapon.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
No, no.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
uh uh and it it could be done so easily because i- i- most small towns
are protected by a small town police force.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
You know? And that's it.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Well, I think that -- there's -- really -- been a strengthening, and I hope
they can -- get it together without this.  Part of the problem with that
is the ~CIA and the ~FBI and who's going to be in charge because they
want to create this new position.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
((I)) No, they've always
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
And, so nobody wants to -- give up -- power
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
and, you know, you -- in this case, and and going forward, we have to
put the good of -- the country -- and the good of the world.
