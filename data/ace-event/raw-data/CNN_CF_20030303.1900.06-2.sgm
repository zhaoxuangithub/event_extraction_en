</HEADLINE>

<SPEAKER> NOVAK </SPEAKER>
OK. Question from the audience.

<SPEAKER> UNIDENTIFIED MALE </SPEAKER>
Hi. I'm Paul Avalar (ph) from Tempe, Arizona. I had a question also about
Khalid Shaikh Mohammed. And now how are people going to argue that the
U.S. can no longer both fight a war with Iraq and also fight terrorism,
specifically al Qaeda?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> NOVAK </SPEAKER>
That's a great question. It's an unanswerable point. He hasn't been able
to answer it. And Tom Andrews (ph) wasn't able to answer it.

<SPEAKER> BEGALA </SPEAKER>
Look, we need allies to catch these guys. We got him because the
Pakistanis got him. We didn't get him. We go to war in Iraq, 200,000
people start protesting in Pakistan, they put too much pressure on the
government. It becomes impossible for those governments to cooperate with
us like they're cooperating now. We go to war in Iraq, it would be the
worst thing we can do...

<SPEAKER> NOVAK </SPEAKER>
You know the one thing the Democrats can't stand is good news. It is just
something you cannot handle.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> BEGALA </SPEAKER>
No. What I can't stand is a president who is going to screw up our war
against terrorism when I thought that was his job. From the left, I'm
Paul Begala. Good night for CROSSFIRE.

<SPEAKER> NOVAK </SPEAKER>
From the right, I'm Robert Novak. Join us again next time for another
edition of CROSSFIRE.
