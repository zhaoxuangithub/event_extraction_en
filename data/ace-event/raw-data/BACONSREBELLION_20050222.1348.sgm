Anyone who has spent any time in NVA over the last 40 years is
familiar with the Giant grocery store chain. When the chain passed from
its private owners a few years ago, problems began. These problems
multiplied when the New England chain Stop n' Shop acquired Giant. Add
new competition--Food Lion, Harris Teeter, and Wegman's--and loyalty to
Giant, once an article of faith, is dissipating. It's a cautionary tale
for business and for any long-standing organization seeking to change.

Michael Barbaro has an article on Giant's recent problems in the
Washington Post , plus he took questions online today. One interesting
note: most of the online negative comments about Giant come from
Maryland residents. Most of the new stores competing with Giant are in
Virginia.

I'm new to this area (1 year) so I can't really comment on Giant.
Seems like an ok store...I prefer Harris Teeter.

Now Ukrops! That's a well run enterprise.

We Richmonders, we do love our Ukrops! We're fiercely loyal.

I worked there as a youngster many years back. Bagged groceries. And
I remember one day they had a dozen japanese businessmen touring the
place trying to figure out how they did it...
