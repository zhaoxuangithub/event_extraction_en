all lumber, no filler. that's the verdict after baseball
officials x-rayed sam why sosa's entire inventory of bat
and found no evidence of cork or any other substance. that
seems to support his contention that the bat got him
ejected tuesday night was a fluke. still a decision on
what, if any punishment he will face in the wake of that
incident tuesday night. gary tuchman standing by in
chicago, with the latest on the sosa saga outside of
wrigley field.

reporter: leon, hello to you. three hours from now the
chicago cubs take the field against the tampa bay devil
rays here at wrigley field and sammy sosa will be out there
with them but how long will he? we could find out today.
his punishment, suspension for using a corked bat for use
-- which is illegal during a game. since the incident
33,000 fans in the stands for a night game he received a
standing ovation from almost all of them. i heard a few
boos but almost everyone standing. not everyone believing
this man's story, which is it was a mistake but he's a hero
here. these people want to believe his story. it happened
tuesday night. in the first inning he hit a ground ball.
scored a run. when he hit the ball, the bat broke. the
umpires found cork in the bat. it's illegal because when
you put it in the bat it makes the meat lighter. they
hollow out the bat and stick the cork in there to mask the
hollow sound. then you can swing it lighter and you can
swing it faster. they took 76 of his bats for analysis.
they x-rayed the bats. the x-rays all came back negative.
but did major league baseball have all of sammy sosa's bats?

we are, as i said, confident, based on not only the
presence of security in the club house but also the level
of cooperation, the record keeping that we reviewed and so
forth, that we have all of the bats. so i don't want anyone
to misconstrue what i said. it is conceivable because we
didn't have physical presence in the club house that we do
not have them all but we are very confident that we do.

i'm man enough to take everything that i've done for. and i
still walk yesterday like a man and take the blame. but the
media today, they got it like i'm a criminal and that's
something that really bothered me and hurt me as a man.

reporter: now, why did sammy sosa have this corked bat?
well, he says he has it because he uses it for batting
practice to put on a show for the fans. they asked him how
many times he's used it during batting practice and he says
three or four times. that raises the question does major
league baseball have a rule about using corked bats during
batting practice. we asked
