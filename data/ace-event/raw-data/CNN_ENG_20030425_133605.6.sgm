tariq aziz's sun ziad looks worried. he's willing to talk
with us, but not be interviewed. as he explains how his
father negotiated his surrender. he says his father's
night-time handover was dignified, that u.s. forces offered
medical support for his father's heart condition, that has
caused two heart attacks recently. they don't know when to
expect him back, and have been told he faces lots of
questions. outside, u.s. troops provide occasional
protection. nearby, a neighbor hopes all will be well.
another neighbor comes to our car to give his opinion. he
was a normal person, he says. a good neighbor, but a bad
politician. at their nearby store, they prepare to open for
their first day of business since the war. aziz was a
politician he said. it's saddam and the others americans
have problems with. maybe he gives us information about the
missing people, and perhaps saddam hussein. further down
the road, these men wait for a ride. neither have anything
bad to say about aziz. we call him mr. aziz, and i'm proud
of him, says this former traffic cop. he was cultured, and
i wish someone like him rules us. his friend adds, if all
the leaders stayed in baghdad, then the americans will
catch them. across town in a less affluent neighborhood,
reactions to aziz's arrest are profoundly different. i
didn't hear about it, explains this man, because we didn't
have electricity. when we explained the news to the crowd,
a bystander steps forward. america is playing a trick on us
he says. where is our government and our security? at the
pickle store, passions are enflamed by the lack of
services. aziz is a war criminal says ahmed. he should get
the death penalty, just like saddam, 60 times over. we give
mr. bush six months to get things right he says, going on
to explain, if not, we will fight the americans. the
biggest problem tariq aziz' family says they now face is
that aziz is now safely in u.s. custody, they don't know
how safe they are out on baghdad's streets. nic robertson,
cnn, baghdad.
