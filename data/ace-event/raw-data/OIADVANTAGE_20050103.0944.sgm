Here's an entertaining little morsel from Business Week Online (no
byline given):

But on the subject of succession, those two look like role models
compared with insurance giant American International Group Inc. ( AIG ),
whose aging CEO has no plans to retire. Maurice R. "Hank" Greenberg, who
turns 80 in May, groomed two sons to be successors, but both have since
left AIG.Greenberg Sr. then created an office of the chairman in 2002,
which includes co-COOs Martin J. Sullivan and Donald P. Kanak. Both are
considered possible successors, but the board won't know Greenberg's
preference until his departure, when it opens a sealed letter. Perhaps
this is a good time for a quick refresher.... The CEO works for the
board ...end lesson.

I guess it is not as straight forward when your CEO is also chairman
and one of the largest shareholders. It would be tempting to get on my
high horse right now about the need to separate the positions of CEO and
Chairman but to be honest with you I don't really believe that. I know
CEO/chair duality is a popular cause for corporate governance. However
there is little empirical evidence to suggest that separating these
roles affects firm performance in either a positive or negative way.
Having a combined CEO/Chairman does reduce the ability of the board to
act as a check on management and this does mean that you need to be more
critical in your assessment of the trustworthiness of the top management
team. This downside of having a combined CEO/chair is offset by (1) a
reduction of coordination and communication costs at the top of the
organization and (2) an increase in the negotiating position of the CEO
when dealing with suppliers, potential merger partners, etc. #2 could be
particularly useful in a dynamic industry.

I do however look more carefully at the top management team of a
company with a CEO/Chair before investing. It is important that you can
get a sense of the trustworthiness of the CEO. Is there high turnover
among senior managers? Is there a record of regulatory problems? If the
CEO is new, I also look at the performance of the CEO's previous
company. I am most concerned if the fortunes of the prior employer took
a sudden turn for the worse after the CEO left.
