<SUBJECT> BTK why is it so difficult to get him? </SUBJECT>

Watching Larry King last night about the BTK killer and something just
seems off about the whole thing. I don't understand -- weren't prints
taken, etc? they have witnesses and I feel they have a whole lot more
stuff. What about prints, DNM taken off of current envelopes, etc., he
sent? I ~know~ and realize how difficult it is to get these serial
killers, but still. An author plugging his book on LK claims and with a
good bit of blow that the investigation was/is as big as
Kennedy's. Really? I don't know, still feel something's off.

A serial killer in Wichita, Kansas who killed at least 8 people in the '70s
and '80s. BTK stands for bind, torture, and kill. He sent several letters
to the police and the media during that time. And now he is communicating
with them again, sending tokens from his victims. Or someone is playing a
big hoax. I've wondered too, with all the forensic advances in the past 25
years why he hasn't been identified. Here's a link.

You do well to wonder why the BTK killer was not captured until
yesterday.

The informal speculation is that the Wichita police department was not
up to the task.

Consider this:

-One of the BTK killer's victims lived on the same street as the killer

-The BTK killer once called up a police dispatcher and told her of the
crime he just committed, and still they could not catch him

-the BTK killer was a known nitpicker and nuissance. This is actually
a indicator in profiles of serial killers and mastermind terrorists.

-the BTK killer was only found out when his daughter recognized certain
traits and turned in her DNA, which was a close match to the DNA on
file for her father. Like in the case of the Unibomber, if it wasn't
for the foresight and charity of a relative, the BTK killer would still
be loose.

I was once reading how a criminal was being tracked in Washington, DC,
and how he escaped a police dragnet several times, once by taking a
taxi. Though there are very brave police, to a large extent the police
have no incentive to capture a criminal, just to stay out of harm's way
and to collect facts after the fact. The rich hire private security
for a reason--public security is often inadequate.

What does BTK stand for? I read the article in the newspaper this morning
and no where did it answer that question. (And it's probably so obvious I
will slap the side of my head when I find out.)

I think it's Bind, Torture and Kill. Or something like that.

I believe Bind Torture Kill = BTK.
My point about taking so long ... for thirty years people didn't feel safe.
The LE has an obligation to keep safe.
I bet the neighbors are going through hell.
