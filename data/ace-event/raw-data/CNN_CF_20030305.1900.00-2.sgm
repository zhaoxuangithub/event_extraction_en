Well, those of you who still believe the myth of the liberal media should
consider this: MSNBC, an obscure cable channel, has fired Phil Donahue,
the host of its highest-rated show. A memo from inside NBC, reported on
the Web site allyourtv.com, and today in "The Washington Post," shows NBC
big wigs feared that the liberal Mr. Donahue represented in the words of
the NBC memo -- quote -- "a difficult public face for NBC at a time of
war, while our competitors are waving the flag at every opportunity
because he seems to delight in presenting guests who are anti-war,
anti-Bush and skeptical of the administration's motives." So there it is,
according to NBC. Phil Donahue was fired because he's a liberal. In fact,
the only liberal with the solo cable talk show. NBC, of course, is a
division of the conglomerate GE, where they apparently only bring right
wing things to life.

I actually like Phil Donahue. I've interviewed him a number of times. His
arguments are really dumb. I don't know if you've listened to Phil
Donahue. Delightful guy, but his arguments don't make a lot of sense and
I think that is the problem with liberal talk show hosts -- you excluded,
of course, and James. But the arguments, actually, don't hold up very
well. Have you noticed that?

You know, you can argue back and forth, but you shouldn't fire someone
because of their political views and that's what NBC has done and shame
on the General Electric corporation. He had the highest-rated show on the
network.

I used to work there. They're good to me. They're very nice people and
they're very good to me...

OK, OK, I'm not beat up on MSNBC.
