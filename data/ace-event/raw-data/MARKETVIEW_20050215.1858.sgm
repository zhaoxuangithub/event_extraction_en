G's Investing argues that Alan Greenspan is a George Lucas-esque
figure : In the Star Wars universe of George Lucas, he portrays a
benevolent dictatorship (or benevolent monarchy) as being superior to a
democracy, with the democracy being the system rife with bureaucracy and
bloat. With Greenspan's unspoken position as economic czar, that's what
we have right now: a benevolent dictatorship of the Fed. But one of the
why dictatorships are so inferior to democracies is that democracy
offers a stable, peaceful transfer of power. Will we have that at the
Fed, when Greenspan leaves

Indeed.

Can't remember where I saw this, maybe at socialsecuritychoice.org.
Anyways, the battle lines for social security privatization are being
identified as those who are for Choice and Ownership (Bush), versus
those who equate investing in the SP500 as playing the slot machines
(AARP, most Democrats, etc).

The battle is now for the endorsement of Sir Alan Greenspan. Where
will Dr. Greenshades come down in this debate? What will he say on
privatization and the associated costs with implementing such a system?
I think that'll have a pretty big impact on what happens next...

Ooohhh... I can't tell you how much I want to take sides here, but
I'm trying to keep my political opinions out of this -- I'd really hate
to alienate half my political audience in a single endorsement. So I'll
just note that I don't see it as quite so black-and-white, and I think
some of the compromises (like reducing taxes for parents, on the grounds
that children are the assets backing Social Security) might be useful
and -- we are dealing with a win-or-lose, vote-or-not situation --
practical.

Yeah, I'm interested in hearing some obtuse Greenspanisms regarding
this topic...
