NEW YORK, March 11 (AFP)

The world's most powerful fine art auction houses, Sotheby's and
Christie's, have agreed to pay 40 million dollars to settle an
international price-fixing scam, Sotheby's said.

The payment, if approved by the courts, would settle a slew of suits
by clients over auctions held between 1993 and 2000 outside the
United States, it said in a statement.

"Under the terms of the settlement agreement, Sotheby's and
Christie's will each pay 20 million dollars," said Sotheby's, which
operates in 34 countries.

The deal required threatened British and Canadian claims against both
auction houses to be dropped.

Buyers and sellers also would have to agree not to pursue further
cases in foreign courts.

The litigation covers buyers in auctions outside the United States
between January 1, 1993 and February 7, 2000, and sellers between
September 1, 1995 and February 7, 2000.

Similar claims over US-based auctions were settled in an agreement
struck in September 2000 for a total of 512 million dollars.

In December 2001, a Manhattan jury convicted Sotheby's main
shareholder and former chairman Alfred Taubman of entering into a
price-fixing agreement with Christie's.

Four months later, the billionaire was sentenced to one year in
prison and a 7.5-million-dollar fine over the price-fixing, which
prosecutors said had cost clients of both firms 400 million dollars.

Christie's was not prosecuted in the United States after its
management agreed to testify against Sotheby's and provide documents
needed to prove fraudulent intent.

Together, Sotheby's and Christie's control more than 90 percent of
the fine art and antiques market.

Sotheby's said it would record the 20-million-dollar settlement as a
special charge for 2002. It would be funded in two payments of 10
million dollars each upon preliminary and final court approval.
