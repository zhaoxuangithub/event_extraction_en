reporter: before the war, i was in jordan. we were waiting for the
iraqi refugees to show off. everyone thought would stream from iraq
and from baghdad into the jordan, like did in 1991. but the iraqi
didn't show up. on april 9th, about 130 journalists from around the
world including myself and a couple of reporters, we were going to try
to cross the border because we were all desperate to get into iraq,
two days after the saddam statue fell and we all knew it was over. my
name is eric salees, i am a photographer at detroit free press and
currently working in baghdad and been here about a week and a half.

wanting their jobs back. and this gentleman was kind of in charge of
the whole operation and one man has his arms up yelling at him, was
basically an angry officer demanding his job. we came across a
checkpoint and there were about maybe five, six iraqi locals with
ak-47 machine guns and checking cars. those kind of neat that the
iraqis are taking pride in the fall of the regime and wanting to
restore order themselves. we had heard rumors of an underground
prison. and rumor had it there was a bunch of kuwaitis and one
american held in this underground prison that people forgot about. so
we went into this bunker hoping to find a prison and run into these
prisoners and instead we ran into a room fulls of weapons from bullets
to hand grenade, land mines, rocket-propelled grenades. besides
weapon, there was paperwork all over the
