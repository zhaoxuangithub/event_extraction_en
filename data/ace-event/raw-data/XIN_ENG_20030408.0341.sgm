Roundup: UK, US downplay divide on UN role in post-war Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BELFAST, Britain, April 8 (Xinhua)

A two-day summit between British Prime Minister Tony Blair and US
President George W. Bush ended here Tuesday with both countries
trying to minimize splits on UN role in rebuilding Iraq after the
ongoing US-led war against the country is over.

As the US-led coalition troops are reportedly thrusting into Baghdad
and the second Iraqi city of Basra, Blair and Bush agreed there would
be a "vital role" for the United Nations in post-war Iraq.

During their first war summit on March 27 at Camp David,  Blair and
Bush became divided over what a role the United Nations will play in
postwar Iraq, when Bush gave no positive reaction to Blair 's
suggestion of a strong UN role.

After the Camp David talks, Blair, who analysts say has been pursuing
a special relationship with Washington in order to restore Britain's
traditional role as a transatlantic "bridge", was forced to readjust
his tone.

Blair and Bush were expected to bridge their gap on the issue by
reaching an agreement on UN role in post-war Iraq, some analysts said
even before this summit at Hillsborough, south of Belfast, the second
of its kind since the war broke out on March 20.

In a joint written statement, the two allies pledged to seek UN
Security Council resolutions to affirm Iraq's territorial integrity,
ensure aid delivery and endorse an "appropriate" post- conflict
administration for Iraq.

"We welcome the appointment by the United Nations Secretary- General
of a special adviser for Iraq to work with the people of Iraq and
coalition representatives," the statement added.

The United Nations would have a "vital role" in the effort to repair
Iraq's infrastructure, Blair told reporters at a news conference
after his talks with Bush, downplaying UN role in emphasizing that
ultimately the country must be run by the Iraqi people.

"The key is that Iraq in the end should be governed by the Iraqi
people," Blair said, pledging that British and US forces would not
stay in the country "a day longer than necessary".

It was a "false choice" to debate whether Iraq should be run by
coalition forces or the United Nations, said Blair, who was believed
to be in favor of a stronger UN role in post-conflict Iraq than Bush.

Echoing Blair, Bush said the UN would play a role in all aspects of
post-war Iraq, from humanitarian aid to a future interim authority,
adding that Iraq would "move as quickly as possible" to an interim
authority made up of Iraqis from inside and outside the country.

However, when pressed on what precisely the UN role would be, Bush on
Tuesday mentioned only humanitarian work, "suggesting" people to
staff the interim authority and helping Iraq "progress."

"When we say vital role for the United Nations, we mean vital role
for the United Nations in all aspects of the issue, whether it be
humanitarian aid, or whether it be helping to stand up an interim
authority. The Iraqi people will decide who's on the Iraqi interim
authority," said Bush.

Bush did not spell out how much power the United Nations would have,
nor did he elaborate on Washington's plans to place US officials
alongside Iraqis in the interim administration.

Differences still remain between the United States and Britain,
analysts said, over the speed with which Iraq should be handed to an
interim Iraqi administration, and the extent to which a US-led group
of generals and former diplomats should effectively run the country.

Yet, analysts argued, both Britain and the United States hope their
agreed vision of a postwar scenario will placate anti-war nations
such as France, Germany and Russia.

"We will move as quickly as possible to place governmental
responsibilities under the control of an interim authority composed
of Iraqis from both inside and outside the country," Bush vowed at
the joint news conference with Blair, adding that the interim
authority would serve until a permanent government could be chosen by
the Iraqi people.

"Rebuilding of Iraq will require the support and expertise of the
international community. We are committed to working with
international institutions, including the United Nations, which will
have a vital role to play in this task," Bush added.

Blair also pleaded the world to avoid "endless diplomatic wrangles"
over the future of Iraq like the international dispute over a second
UN resolution on Iraq that preceded the war.

France and Germany, which were most vocal in opposing this US- led
war against Iraq, have been insisting that the United Nations should
play a central role in the phase of post-war Iraq.

On the unresolved dispute between Europe and the United States,
analysts say, Blair might again have to make a difficult choice, but
he is very likely to support the United States, which Britain can not
afford to fall out with.
