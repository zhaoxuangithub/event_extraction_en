Rachel Hunter seeks divorce from pop icon Rod Sewart -- finally
</HEADLINE>

LOS ANGELES, June 17 (AFP)

Supermodel Rachel Hunter on Tuesday filed for divorce from her
estranged rocker husband Rod Stewart, four years after the couple
separated, court papers showed.

Hunter, 34, filed for divorce in Los Angeles Superior Court, citing
irreconcilable differences with the 58-year-old rock star to whom she
has been married for nearly 13 years.

How the assets of the couple -- they have a daughter, Renee, 11, and
a son, Liam, 8 -- will divided has yet to be decided, the documents
showed.

The celebrity couple spit up very publicly four years ago and each
has since had well-publicized relationships with others.

New Zealand-born Hunter reportedly had a fling with British pop star
Robbie Williams, while British star Stewart has been much
photographed with his reported girlfriend, blond photographer Penny
Lancaster.

Stewart has said that after two failed marriages, he felt it
unrealistic to expect couples to commit to each other for life and
suggested that the words "til death do us part" should be removed
from the wedding ceremony.

Stewart's 1979 marriage to Alana Hamilton lasted five years and
produced two children.

The raspy-voiced singer who once dated Britt Ekland is best known for
hit songs including "Maggie May," "Do Ya Think I'm Sexy," "Tonight's
the Night" and "Young Turks".
