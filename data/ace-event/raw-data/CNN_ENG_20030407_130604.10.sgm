looking at like pictures of heirs force one now on the ground at a
royal air force base outside of belfast, northern ireland. it's called
aldergrove, just outside belfast. the president of the united states
coming for a brief two-day summit with the british prime minister tony
blair. they'll be talking about a postwar iraq among other important
subjects. they'll also have an opportunity to review the so-called
road map for israeli/palestinian peace negotiations to get off the
ground. they also want to review what the status is of northern
ireland right now as that peace process seems to be taking hold. been
relatively quiet in northern ireland over the past few years. this is
the third time in as many weeks that president bush and prime minister
blair will be sitting down to review station, war strategy, as they go
forward together. go forward as close allies in trying to help put
together a new iraq. there are some significant differences in their
strategy, including what role precisely the united nations should have
in determining the future of iraq. they'll try to thrash all of that
out. you're look at the picture of air force one taxiing in on the
tarmac, getting ready for the president. as we watched this picture of
the air force one getting into this airport i want to bring in our
military analyst general dan crisman to go over what happens happening
in baghdad. seems pretty far away from belfast right now, general. but
decisions that these two leaders make could have a significant impact
on the future of iraq. first of all, general, we'll keep this picture
up of air force one, talk about what you sense is happening on the
streets of baghdad right now.

wolf, it's clearly the final phase. the engame which is unfoaling
right now. i think it's very significant not only in baghdad but basra
itself. you have coalition forces there in some strength. apparently
three ba talians of the u.s. 3rd division in baghdad three coalition
assets, three huge battle groups in basra itself which the u.k. has
there, what they've developed here, wolf, over the last several weeks
i very clear and increasingly clear intelligence as to what the final
remnants of the regime leadership are in terms of where they are
embedded in the cities. what they're doing is going in now, very
carefully, obviously some symbolic raids against palaces. but the more
important presence is to go after what intelligence delivers and
that's where these key leaders are located. they're going to be
defended fanatically but intelligence is so crucial from aerial
platforms and special ops personnel to give the three assets the intel
which they need to close with and eliminate final remnants of the
regime in those citys. this is a very important final phase here,
wolf, and it looks like the closure is coming here now more rapidly
than we anticipated.

as we continue to watch air force one, now on the ground outside
belfast, northern ireland, we'll be watching president bush emerge
from the plane momentarily. we'll continue to have live coverage of
that. when walter rodgers, our embedded reporter with the 3-7th
cavalry says three battalions of troops are on the ground, inside
baghdad itself, have taken up positions they're going to spend the
night there presumably, how many soldiers are we talking about right
now?
</TURN>
<TURN>
between 700 and 1,000. the task forces really, wolf are probably built
around the m-2 bradley the basic infantry fighting vehicle. it is the
equipment of choice for a task force like this to go into baghdad.
it's cannon, it's ability to implace troops and fire through the
firing ports in that bradley vehicle to take them in under protection.
it's a very, very important piece of equipment. these are probably
mechanized heavy task forces that have overhead aerial platforms to
provide direct support. it's significant the degradation of the iraqi
air defenses has allowed a-10s, predators, u-s, other assets to hover
and loiter and provide the overhead protection to these task
