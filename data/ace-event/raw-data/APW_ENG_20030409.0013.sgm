U.S. troops tighten grip on capital, U.S. military criticized for
media casualties

BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP)

U.S. forces tightened their grip throughout Baghdad, entering the
city for the first time from the north, seizing a military airport
and battling snipers and Republican Guard fighters. Meanwhile, the
U.S. military faced sharp criticism over assaults that killed three
foreign journalists.

Pentagon officials said Tuesday they didn't know whether Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein died in the U.S. airstrike on a Baghdad
neighborhood the day before. The strike destroyed three nearby houses
and killed at least two people.

U.S. Marines battled snipers as they fought deeper into the capital
from the east. They seized the Rasheed Airport and captured enough
ammunition for an estimated 3,000 troops. Ominously, they also took a
prison where they found U.S. Army uniforms and chemical weapons suits
possibly belonging to American POWs.

Some army units routed Iraqi fighters from a Republican Guard
headquarters inside the capital. Others discovered a 12-room complex
inside a cave, complete with white marble floors and fluorescent
lighting.

Members of the U.S. Army's V Corps opened up a new front by entering
Baghdad from the north.

The toll on Iraqi civilians four days after Americans first
penetrated the Baghdad outskirts is unknown. But the World Health
Organization said Baghdad's hospitals were running out of supplies to
treat the burns, shrapnel wounds and spinal injuries caused by the
fighting.

Iraqi officials, however, remained defiant, saying Iraq's forces
would never surrender to American forces: ``They will be burnt,''
said Information Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf.

In central Baghdad, a Reuters cameraman and a cameraman for Spain's
Telecinco died when an American tank fired on the Palestine Hotel.

``The incident ... raises questions about the judgment of the
advancing U.S. troops who have known all along that this hotel is the
main base for almost all foreign journalists in Baghdad,'' Reuters
Editor-in-Chief Geert Linnebank said.

Tareq Ayyoub, a journalist with Al-Jazeera, died when a U.S. warplane
bombed the Arab-language satellite television's office. An Abu Dhabi
TV office in Baghdad also was hit.

Al-Jazeera categorically denied that its Baghdad bureau had been used
by Iraqi forces to fire on U.S. troops. U.S. Central Command said it
fired on the TV office and the hotel after U.S. forces came under
``significant'' fire from those buildings.

Associated Press photographer Jerome Delay said he watched from the
top floor of the hotel as American tanks took up positions on the
bridge. ``All the shooting was concentrated on the bridge and across
the river,'' where U.S. forces were located, he said.

It was not clear whether any Iraqi leader had been killed in the
airstrike targeting Saddam in an upscale Baghdad neighborhood. Iraqi
rescue workers pulled two bodies from the rubble but said the toll
could be as high as 14.

``I don't know whether he survived,'' U.S President George W. Bush
said of Saddam at a joint news conference with British Prime Minister
Tony Blair. ``The only thing I know is that he's losing power.''

Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Mohammed Al-Douri, said Tuesday he believes
that Saddam is alive, although al-Douri acknowledged he has not
communicated with Baghdad.

Bush and Blair sought to minimize their differences over who should
govern and rebuild Iraq. Blair favors a stronger U.N. role than Bush.

``There will be a vital role for the U.N. in the reconstruction of
Iraq,'' Blair said. ``But the key is that Iraq in the end will be run
by the Iraqi people.''

In northern Iraq, Kurdish forces tightened their ring around Kirkuk
on Tuesday, following heavy coalition airstrikes on Iraqi fronts.
Kurdish militia took control of Sekamian plateau, about 10 kilometers
(six miles) north of Kirkuk, Kurdish media reported. The area affords
a commanding view of the city and the vast oil fields of Iraq's No. 2
oil region.

The U.S. military said two planes had been lost.

An A-10 ``Warthog'' warplane was shot down near Baghdad, believed to
be the first fixed-wing aircraft downed by an Iraqi surface-to-air
missile since the war began. U.S. Central Command said the pilot
ejected, was recovered by ground forces and was in good condition.

A U.S. F-15E jet fighter also went down early Monday and a search was
under way for its two-man crew, the military announced Tuesday.
Officials did not say whether the plane was shot down or crashed
accidentally.

British forces in southern Iraq worked to restore order in the
heavily looted streets of Basra, as desperate citizens swarmed water
tanker trucks the day after British soldiers claimed Iraq's second
largest city.

British forces also began establishing the country's first postwar
administration Tuesday, granting a local sheik power to set up an
administrative committee representing the groups in the region.
