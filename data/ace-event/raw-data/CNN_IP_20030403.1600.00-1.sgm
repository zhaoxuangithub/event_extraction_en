Thanks very much, Judy. With the power out now in Baghdad, we're getting
word that loudspeakers have been blaring in the Iraqi capital, urging
citizens to go to the international airport there, presumably to defend
it against coalition forces. Now that armored columns of U.S.-led troops
have reached the outskirts of Baghdad, eyewitnesses report fighting and
shelling around Saddam Hussein International Airport. In the final push
to Baghdad, U.S. forces face limited resistance from Iraqi troops. But
the Pentagon believes some Iraqi Republican Guard units have withdrawn to
the capital for what could be their last stand. Farther south in Basra,
smoke rose over the city as coalition vehicles moved in today. British
forces say they're consolidating their position in Basra's key suburbs.
And in northern Iraq, Kurdish political leaders and members of the Iraqi
opposition are engaged in talks with U.S. military commanders. They
reportedly are exploring the option of joining forces against Saddam
Hussein. Coalition forces launched their latest advances toward Baghdad
in the pre-dawn hours today, heading toward the Iraqi capital from the
southeast and the southwest. The forces encountered limited resistance
along the way and are now poised for the final assault not far from the
edge of the city. Reporter Carl Dinnon of Britain's ITN filed this
report.

Baghdad is now within striking distance as troops make their final thrust
through the desert. Wrecked armor by the sides of the road suggests there
has been some Iraqi opposition. But by and large, the Republican Guard
has either been destroyed or has withdrawn. And the way seems to be open
for coalition forces to close in on the city's southern limits. At
daybreak, U.S. troops pushed through the outskirts of Karbala on the road
to Baghdad, capturing a key bridge on the Euphrates River. Meanwhile,
coalition commanders posted American special forces were now operating at
will. These dramatic pictures show a raid on a presidential palace less
than 60 miles from Baghdad. It seems to have been abandoned, but the
United States said it was still on the trail of Saddam and his closest
circle.

We remain cautiously optimistic. We don't think that the fighting is over
yet, and so there are still options available to the regime, including
the use of weapons of mass destruction. We take that very seriously. We
take it in a sober fashion. And at the same time, we remain prepared to
continue operations.

The Americans say they've destroyed two divisions of the elite Republican
Guard. (on camera): The Medina division, which is one of the toughest
outfits in the Republican Guard is now down to 10 percent of its fighting
strength. That means it's practically inoperative. Others are down to 50
percent, but there's still one or two divisions around 75, 80, 90 percent
of their fighting strength, and they could still put up very stiff
resistance, indeed, when the American forces get en masse to Baghdad
itself. (voice-over): The noose appears to be tightening on Saddam
Hussein. The question is, how desperate he will get before he is finally
toppled. Carl Dinnon, ITV News, Iraq.

In the southern city of Najaf, home to one of Islam's holiest sites,
moments of tension that could have gone either way earlier today. Armed
coalition soldiers moving toward a venerated mosque at the behest of a
Muslim cleric. Angry locals who did not understand their intentions
clearly showed their intentions as well. CNN's Ryan Chilcote is in Najaf.
We're going to get to him shortly. But Judy Woodruff, back in Washington,
has breaking news -- Judy.
