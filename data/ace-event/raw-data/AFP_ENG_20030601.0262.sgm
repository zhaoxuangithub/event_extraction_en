Bush, Putin pal up after Iraq spat, but Iran row simmers

ATTENTION - ADDS Russian foreign minister, US official quotes ///

SAINT PETERSBURG, June 1 (AFP) - US President George W. Bush and
Russian President Vladimir Putin said Sunday their friendship was as
strong as ever, laying aside a dispute over the Iraq war, but barely
concealing a simmering row over Iran's nuclear program.

After talks in Saint Petersburg's grand Konstantinovsky Palace, they
also warned North Korea to abandon its nuclear aspirations and signed
documents implementing the Moscow Treaty, which mandates sharp cuts
in Cold War nuclear weapons stocks.

Swapping smiles, handshakes and hugs at a joint press appearance
after talks linked to Saint Petersburg's 300th anniversary
celebrations, Bush and Putin set out to recreate the buddy atmosphere
of their previous encounters.

"Our relations are stronger than the events that tested it," said
Putin, stressing that despite diverging over Iraq, Russia and the
United States had many common interests.

"It is precisely these things that enable me to call President Bush
my friend, not only personally -- because I do like him a lot -- but
as my counterpart and the president of a friendly nation," he said,
earning a grin from Bush.

But both men observed an uneasy truce over US concerns about Russian
aid to the nuclear program of Iran, whom Bush has labeled part of an
"axis of evil" that also included Iraq and North Korea.

"We are concerned about Iran's advanced nuclear program and urge Iran
to comply in full with its obligations under the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty," Bush said.

A senior US diplomat said Bushehr remains one of the biggest
irritants in Russia-US relations.

"We think that it would be wise for Russia to go slow on the Bushehr
project until the wider Iranian nuclear program is more clearly
understood," the US diplomat said after the informal summit talks.

"Our belief is that any proliferation, coming from any source, should
be stopped."

The United States believes that what Iran says is a peaceful civilian
nuclear program is a pretext for weapons manufacture.

Washington has been pressuring Russia to stop building a nuclear
power plant in Bushehr, southern Iran, which it has so far declined
to do.

"I appreciate Vladimir Putin's understanding of the issue and his
willingness to work with me and others to solve this potential
problem," said Bush.

Putin insisted that the two sides were "closer than they seem" on the
issue.

"We do not need to be convinced of the fact that there should no
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction," he said.

But in a sharp remark that jolted the bonhomie, Putin warned Russia
was not yet ready to sever nuclear ties with Iran.

"We are against the pretext of using the nuclear weapons program in
Iran as a lever in unfair business competition against us," he said.

Bush signalled that Russia would not pay a similar price as France
and Germany for opposing the US-led war in Iraq, inviting his "good
friend" Putin to his weekend retreat outside Camp David in Washington
in September.

Putin last visited Bush at his Texas ranch in November 2001.

There was no word on the fate of billions of dollars of Russian oil
contracts in Iraq, whose oil industry is now under the administration
of the United States and Britain in line with latest UN resolutions,
which Russia was persuaded to back.

But Putin noted that "Russian companies have a wealth of experience
operating in Iraq and we intend to continue our cooperation in this
area, with Iraq and in Iraq."

"What the president (Putin) meant was that at times, and we have come
across this, there were unreasonable complaints about Russian
companies' cooperation with Iran," said Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov,
pointing the finger clearly at the United States after the summit.

Bush and Putin also signed formal documents putting into effect a
strategic arms reduction treaty that slashes the two sides' nuclear
weapons to a range of 1,700 to 2,200 nuclear warheads by the year
2012.

Bush arrived in Saint Petersburg on Saturday, when he also briefly
met German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, whose opposition to the Iraq
war had soured his relationship with Washington, at a dinner hosted
by Putin.

Bush and Putin were scheduled to leave straight after their talks for
the Group of Eight summit of the largest industrialised nations in
Evian, France.
