right now, cast our eyes to the middle east, getting word that a
massive assembly of shiite muslims is now come together in beirut,
lebanon. this is a rather remarkable arrangement because they are
cheering there the arrival of khatami, the president of iran. now, he
is making a trip and you see him there with his hands raised, there
with the cloak on, shaking his fists, hands classped there, in a
salute to the crowd. president khatami is in beirut and what is
observed here is very closely watched, what kind of words he'll utter
when he speaks to this crowd. iran now being pressured by the u.s. to
back off on supporting hezbollah. hezbollah is an organization based
in lebanon that has beenify dn dn been tied to terrorist activity and
peter bergen mentioned saudi hezbollah an organization working in that
country. the key is going to fwo see whether or not khatami actually
does signal that he is going to be heeding the word of president bush
and backing off in some way in supporting hezbollah. that will be a
very important development as we continue to watch the mideast peace
process between palestinians and israelis develop. we are seeing that
secretary of state colin powell also traveling through the region,
trying to get regional leaders there to put more pressure on the
palestinians to stop any terrorist activities that may be happening on
their behalf as well in that region. we'll watch and listening very
closely to president khatami's visit there in beirut, lebanon. moving
on, president bush on road today, where is campaigning again for a tax
cut package. likely to comment on the developing story in saudi
arabia. chris burns traveling with the president, he joins us from
indianapolis. hi, chris.
