canada is on the path to becoming the third country to
allow gay marriage. the federal government will not appeal
the court ruling that cleared the way for same-sex unions.
prime minister jean chretien says the government will now
draft legislation legalizing gay marriages. and the u.s.
government can repeat, can withhold the names of people
detained as part of the 9/11 investigation. that's the
decision from a federal appeals court reversing a lower
court ruling. the justice department argued that releasing
the names could hamper ongoing investigations. as we've
been reporting, only within the past hour or so, there's
been a shooting incident in central israel, not far from
the west bank. a 7-year-old israeli girl has died. two
others, her father apparently and another sister, have been
wounded in this incident. we're going to continue to get
more details on this late-breaking development and bring
you those details when we have them.
