lawyers in texas are trying to keep their client from becoming the
300th person executed in the state since 1982, when texas resumed
capital punishment. they're asking the supreme court to block
tonight's scheduled execution of delma banks. banks was convicted of
shooting and killing a 16-year-old at a park in 1980. his lawyers say
his trial attorney did a bad job and the prosecutors improperly kept
african americans off his jury. he'd be the 11th killer put to death
in texas this year.
