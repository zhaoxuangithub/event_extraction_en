It had been very quiet inside Israel since the start of the U.s.-led war
against Iraq. Many Israelis were fearing that quiet would come to an end.
And it did on this day. Police say a suicide bomber blew himself up
outside this cafe, called The London Cafe, earlier Sunday afternoon. We
can show you some pictures from earlier Sunday. People here tell us the
cafe was filled with people enjoying the spring weather. Many here though
say they are relieved only one person dead, the suicide bomber. Dozens,
though, injured, including some Israeli soldiers, because according to an
eyewitness, he said many soldiers were here also enjoying the spring
weather.

Then it was big bomb. And many soldier. Two soldiers were down here. Many
blood. Many people skip from here. Big paranoia.

There had been many terrorist attacks here in Netanya, including the
deadliest suicide bombing ever in Israel almost exactly a year ago, March
27, at the Park Hotel during Passover, 29 people killed in that attack.
As for this attack, the Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad is
claiming responsibility. According to a leaflet from the group obtained
by CNN, the group says the attack was to show the union of Palestinians
with the people of Iraq. The group is also claiming that Islamic Jihad
militants are already inside Iraq to carry out attacks against U.S. and
British forces. Israel has been on a heightened state of alert since the
start of the U.S.-led war against Iraq. And now many Israelis fear they
could see more attacks like the one they saw here today as the military
campaign against Saddam Hussein continues. I'm Kelly Wallace, CNN,
reporting from Netanyahu, Israel.
