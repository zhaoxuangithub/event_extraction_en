10. Death of Arafat (2) PLO leader PLO leader Yasser Arafat died in a
Paris hospital last week, after a lot of controversy surrounding his
illness and death.  What do you think caused his illness, and could it
have been something malicious (like poisoning)?  What do you think of
Israel's policies surrounding Arafat's illness and death?  Should
President Bush or a senior US official have attended Arafat's funeral?
Should Israel have let Arafat be buried in Jerusalem?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
Hello?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Joe </SPEAKER>
Hello, my name is Joe.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
I'm James from Detroit.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Joe </SPEAKER>
Uh, from, uh, New Jersey, but I'm living in Atlanta now, going to
college.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
Oh, okay.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Joe </SPEAKER>
All right.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
((I'm sorry.))
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Joe </SPEAKER>
So, uh, what do you think about Arafat?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
Well -- I, uh, I don't think there was anything malicious, uh, in terms
of his death -- uh, just looking at him these last, uh, couple of years
uh, it seems like he had Alzheimer's or something.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Joe </SPEAKER>
Yeah, he has been getting older.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
Yeah, because he was quivering at the mouth and and hands were
shaking.  And -- I would imagine that living in that compound couldn't
have been that conducive to his health.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Joe </SPEAKER>
Yeah, he probably should have been in a hospital or a hospice or
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
Right.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Joe </SPEAKER>
you know, if it was that bad.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
Right.  Right, I'm sure that they, I don't know about, bout -- the uh
sanitary conditions there, but -- I I just don't think it could have
been, uh, conducive to his health.  And as far as, uh, Israel, uh,
allowing -- him to be buried -- uh, in Jerusalem
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Joe </SPEAKER>
That's accept
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
huh?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Joe </SPEAKER>
That's acceptable to me. I mean
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
Well, it, it's acceptable to me, but I don't think it was feasible.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Joe </SPEAKER>
feasible
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
Yeah, given the circumstance in that area right now.  I don't even
know if they would have been able to pull it off,  you know?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Joe </SPEAKER>
Well, uh, so he, in fact he wasn't
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
Pardon me?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Joe </SPEAKER>
so, um -- no, so he wasn't buried in Jerusalem.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
No.  No, they buried him -- uh, inside that compound.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Joe </SPEAKER>
Oh, I see.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
Yeah, they buried him inside that compound.  But like you say, I
don't, I don't -- I personally -- uh -- wouldn't have seen a problem with
it, but -- I just don't think it was feasible. I don't, I don't think
that they would have been -- uh, secure enough to really do it.  I don't
think either side would have really -- let it happen -- and -- and as far as
a senior U.S. official going, I don't think that would have been
necessary either. Um, I know President Bush shouldn't have went -- and
he wasn't going.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Joe </SPEAKER>
Well, I kind of feel, I kind of feel another way. I think a senior
U.S. service in there, should have been there, because I mean -- he,
Arafat's been -- been the one coming to all these peace talks, you know,
with President Clinton and, you know, other
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Joe </SPEAKER>
other um -- litigations towards that.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Joe </SPEAKER>
You know, I think, I think we could have just showed our face and said
you know, yeah, we do recognize this man.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
Mhm.  Well it, they sent someone.  I don't know who it was -- ((It
wasn't))
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Joe </SPEAKER>
It probably, it wasn't anybody important. It was just like a
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
Yeah it was an under secretary, there's no doubt about it. There was
no senior
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Joe </SPEAKER>
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
there was no senior U.S. official there.  There's there's no question
about that.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Joe </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
But, uh -- you know, uh, Bush's policy -- towards, uh, Yasser Arafat has
been hands off
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Joe </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
from from the beginning cause I don't, I don't think he ever even met
with him. Did he?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Joe </SPEAKER>
I don't think so. I don't think so.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
Yeah, I I
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Joe </SPEAKER>
Bush is kind of like, staying away from the whole Israel -- Palestinian
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
Mhm.  Now on his part I think that was a mistake.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Joe </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
Yeah, you know you got to engage people in some type of dialogue
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Joe </SPEAKER>
And
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
if you
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Joe </SPEAKER>
to me, the talk, the peace talks should have continued -- after
Clinton's administration left.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
True.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Joe </SPEAKER>
Cause at the cause at the end Clinton was doing all this peace talk
with Arafat and, um
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
True.  Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Joe </SPEAKER>
((forget)) the um, prime minister in Israel, but he was talking to
him.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
Uh, Sharon.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Joe </SPEAKER>
Sharon, yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
Yeah.  Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Joe </SPEAKER>
They were doing all these talks in Camp David and and it should have
just continued when Br- Bush came into office.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
You're absolutely right. I agree. Like I said, I think that was one of
Bush's biggest mistakes,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Joe </SPEAKER>
Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
not continuing -- the talks.  Because Clinton had came so very close
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Joe </SPEAKER>
Yes.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
to to maybe getting some type of agreement
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Joe </SPEAKER>
No.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
but, uh, Bush just took a hands off approach. He just -- kind of took a
hands off approach.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Joe </SPEAKER>
And now the situation in, you know, Jerusalem and the West Bank is
just -- escalated.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
Absolutely.  And I think too -- Israel's -- position toward Arafat -- in
terms of keeping him sort of like -- uh -- surrounded in that compound -- I
don't think that was a good idea.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Joe </SPEAKER>
No.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
You know, because that, you can't pick a leader for a people.  Whether
you like them or not -- people get to choose who they want to follow,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Joe </SPEAKER>
Exactly.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
and the Palestinians had made it clear -- that Arafat was their leader.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Joe </SPEAKER>
Exactly.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
So, I think that they, we should have found a way -- Israel should have
found a way -- to -- keep some type of dialogue -- going along.  Cause uh, I
mean, you look at what's going on now.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Joe </SPEAKER>
Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
I mean, their policy toward him didn't get them anything.  And then
you got suicide bombing on the one side, and then you got Israel -- you
know, it's like one day, you'll he- a bomb will go off, the next day
Israel will do and air strike and -- you know, it's like going around in
a circle.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Joe </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
It's like going around in a circle.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Joe </SPEAKER>
It's really a bad situation.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
It is.  It is, and it's, it's been so long -- going on, I mean, you're
talking about something that's been going on historically for hundreds
of years.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Joe </SPEAKER>
Hundreds of years and then, it just recently really come into
spectrum,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Joe </SPEAKER>
what, nineteen forty nine?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
Mhm.  Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Joe </SPEAKER>
When um -- the Israel state -- came into being, or whatever.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
Right.  Right.
