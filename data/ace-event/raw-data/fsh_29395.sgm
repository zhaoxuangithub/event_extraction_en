</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Irvin </SPEAKER>
All right. Uh, what do you know about this Scott -- Peterson trial? I
don't know much about it, to be honest with you.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Winnette </SPEAKER>
Oh this is funny because I just, one of my calls the other day was
regarding this.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Irvin </SPEAKER>
Really?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Winnette </SPEAKER>
So uh uh they're act- -- actually that's getting a few different
questions and -- actually the gentleman I got the other day -- hadn't even
heard about it.  Um,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Irvin </SPEAKER>
Oh really?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Winnette </SPEAKER>
Well um,  I've been following it pretty closely.  Um,  I guess because
of -- you know it being a mother and -- being pregnant for a baby.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Irvin </SPEAKER>
Oh, uh-huh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Winnette </SPEAKER>
Um,  kind of hit more to -- I you know to home.  Um,  So you -- how much
of it have you followed? Did, did you -- follow any of it at all when it
was on in the news or in the papers or anything?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Irvin </SPEAKER>
Hardly any of it at all, because -- um -- for one thing -- I do not have a
~TV or a radio and I don't get a daily newspaper.  We get
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Winnette </SPEAKER>
Oh wow.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Irvin </SPEAKER>
we get a weekly newspaper.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Winnette </SPEAKER>
Okay.  Um,  well I'll I don't get any newspapers at the house, but -- I
listen to the radio every morning on my way to work and
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Irvin </SPEAKER>
Oh yeah?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Winnette </SPEAKER>
and uh -- when it first happened it was -- pretty publicized on every
radio station um -- it come across -- on the news and we keep our ~TV on
at my work, because we have a customer waiting area, so
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Irvin </SPEAKER>
Oh, uh-huh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Winnette </SPEAKER>
um actually one of our employees had wa- watched ((happening)) -- so
from that point on we kind of -- talked a lot about it at work and
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Irvin </SPEAKER>
How long ago was it?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Winnette </SPEAKER>
different things.  Um,  it was a year -- almost a year ago.  Over a year
ago?  Because it was just before Christmas -- that it happened.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Irvin </SPEAKER>
Over a year ago.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Winnette </SPEAKER>
Yeah.  Um,  I'm thinking -- I don't know, November, December, I'm not
sure exactly.  But I know it was just before Christmas -- when they had
uh -- it had happened, because she was missing during Christmas and then
they had found her body.  And they -- they found the baby as well.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Irvin </SPEAKER>
Terrible.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Winnette </SPEAKER>
Um,  so when they found the baby, the baby of course had been -- they
don't know if the baby was born, through delivery,  or -- if maybe from
um -- the corpse I guess
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Irvin </SPEAKER>
So the baby was separate.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Winnette </SPEAKER>
maybe extracted it.  Um, actually she was pregnant for the baby.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Irvin </SPEAKER>
But the baby was separate from the body when he found it?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Winnette </SPEAKER>
Yes.  Yep.  Um,  I don't know if ma- I you know I don't know the whole
story for sure, but -- um -- he had -- you know, obviously -- denied that he
was involved anything to do with it. Then they found out that he was
having an affair on her.  And -- then of course when they were
investigating him -- he tried running.  Dyed his hair and -- grew out a
mustache and -- they caught him trying to run with -- quite a bit of cash.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Irvin </SPEAKER>
Wow.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Winnette </SPEAKER>
So I mean,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Irvin </SPEAKER>
(())
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Winnette </SPEAKER>
he's -- in all honesty been guilty all along the way but
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Irvin </SPEAKER>
Uh-huh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Winnette </SPEAKER>
of course you know they've got to give him that reasonable doubt.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Irvin </SPEAKER>
Uh-huh.  So is he is he still um -- in prison now?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Winnette </SPEAKER>
Yeah.  And they're making the determination if -- in fact he will get
the death penalty, or life in prison.  So that's what's is up in the
air right now.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Irvin </SPEAKER>
What state is this in?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Winnette </SPEAKER>
California.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Irvin </SPEAKER>
It's in California.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Winnette </SPEAKER>
And -- um -- I know I had, it was supposed to have be deliberated on -- the
twenty-second of November,  but they had an issue happen with -- one of
the jurors -- so it's postponed everything.  But,  actually they were
trying to pass a law, and I don't know if it ever did take into
effect,  that if in fact a mother was killed, and pregnant,  um -- for
there to be a double murder charge.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Irvin </SPEAKER>
Oh, uh-huh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Winnette </SPEAKER>
And -- they were in fact trying to enforce the death penalty on that
charge if they were -- found guilty on both charges.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Irvin </SPEAKER>
Uh-huh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Winnette </SPEAKER>
And -- so it's kind of up in the air now -- because he -- I believe he got
first degree murder and -- um and then got manslaughter on the baby.  So
he didn't get both first degree murders.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Irvin </SPEAKER>
What's the difference?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Winnette </SPEAKER>
Where -- Um,  I guess because he didn't murder the baby directly.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Irvin </SPEAKER>
Oh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Winnette </SPEAKER>
I'm thinking maybe was the difference.  And because of the the charge
on the baby, they couldn't automatically give him the death penalty,
but -- obviously there's enough -- um, complaints or whatever
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Irvin </SPEAKER>
What was his excuse for doing something horrible like that?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Winnette </SPEAKER>
and -- well he still denies everything.  He has never admitted
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Irvin </SPEAKER>
((Still does))
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Winnette </SPEAKER>
to do it.  um -- But the only thing they can figure is that maybe -- he
wanted back into the bachelor life, and didn't want to be a father,
didn't want to be tied down with a wife and child
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Irvin </SPEAKER>
So he didn't have any other children?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Winnette </SPEAKER>
that was -- No, that was going to be their first.  And actually I don't
even think they were married that long, maybe a year or two.
