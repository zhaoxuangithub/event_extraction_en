<SUBJECT> S Corp Profit distribution and Bankrupcy. </SUBJECT>

My uncle declared bankruptcy in 2003 and his case closed in June 2004.
If I give him shares in my corporation in
Feb 2004 of my S Corporation making him 30% shareholder, and I finally
distributed profit this year, will the
creditors attempt to that take money from him in 2005?

Probably not. But if he was required to list the shares in bankruptcy
filings, and didn't, the answer may be different. I think, though, that any
transaction after the bankruptcy filing date is part of his new life.

Was the trustee informed of the transfer of the shares? Since you gave
your uncle the shares prior to his discharge, the shares should have
become assets available to the bankruptcy estate for the satisfaction of
debts. If the share transfer was reported to the trustee and the trustee
did nothing about them, then you may be ok; however, if you failed to
inform the trustee, then your uncle may be liable for hiding assets, which
would, at the minimum, invalidate his discharge. Even if the transfer
doesn't invalidate the whole discharge, the distribution might be subject
to forfeiture to pay creditors' claims if you failed to inform the trustee
of the share transfer.

You need to speak to a bankruptcy attorney pronto; this is a bankruptcy
matter, not a tax matter.

the bankrupcy filing took place in 2003, but it didnt clear until early
2004 and that was when i gave him the shares. He had no shares in 2003.

Yes, but according to the facts you first gave, he had not yet received the
bankruptcy discharge when you gave him the shares. I believe you had said
that you gave him the shares in February 2004 but that the discharge
didn't come until June of 2004. That means that he received the shares
while he was still in bankruptcy, which means that the shares were
potentially assets that the trustee could use to pay off creditors.

A bankruptcy case doesn't close until you get the discharge order, and
until then everything that the debtor receives is fair game for the
trustee. If the trustee was informed of the shares and did nothing about
it, you are more likely than not ok, but if the trustee wasn't informed of
the fact directly, then you may be in trouble.

If, however, your uncle received the shares after he obtained an order of
discharge from the bankruptcy court, then as a general matter the
creditors cannot go after the shares, unless they can prove that there was
collusion between you and your uncle to hide his assets from them (e.g.,
by putting his assets in the corporation's name and then waiting until
after the bankruptcy to transfer the shares to him).
