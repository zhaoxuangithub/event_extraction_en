she looks very, very healthy. she's grown a lot. and i'm just so
absolutely thrilled. i couldn't believe it. in fact, i had to take a
double take and pull her back away from me and say, "is it really
you?" all of the children out there deserve to come home to their
parents the way -- the way elizabeth has come back to us. and i just
hope and pray that congress will quickly pass the amber alert so that
those children will have a better chance because they cross the state
line and they're out of commission. and we need to have this here. we
really do. but i just am so grateful and so thankful. thank you very
much.

i just brought her little brother william in. and as william and she
saw each other, it was such a wonderful reunion for them to just hug,

her. and couldn't believe, i think, as a 4-year-old now that his
sister is home.

of war that could be coming upon us and a miracle that has been
brought to us, an incredible miracle that has been brought to our
family, words cannot express how grateful we are for the prayers
around the world. do miracles still exist? and the answer is yes. and
we have elizabeth back.

this neighborhood, the federal heights neighborhood, everybody's been
ripped up, everybody's helped, everybody's prayed to do whatever they
can. we thank god for all the searchers, for all the people. in the
history of the world i don't think a little girl's been prayed for
more than elizabeth smart. and we thank you for answering those
prayers.
