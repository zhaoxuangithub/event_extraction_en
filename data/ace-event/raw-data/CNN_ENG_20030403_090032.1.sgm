all right. just about 25 minutes long in that press conference there
at nato headquarters in brussels. he mentioned a headline a short time
ago. u.s. forces moving in on the airports at saddam hussein
international airport, 12 miles west of the city's center. colin
powell saying an end will come soon and toward the end, this regime
will be finished. also a question there about the united nations. a
question about nato about what role these two organizations may play
in rebuilding iraq. colin powell says the u.n. does have a role to
play, what role that is remains to be seen. there was also one other
moment there when you heard a woman asking about the safety of her
husband right now. that woman, we believe s married to one of two
journalists who disappeared in iraq almost two weeks ago, both work
other for the network, itn. we have heard that perhaps both are being
held in basra, possibly in a hospital, but there's no way for us to
confirm their whereabouts, but obviously a lot of concern from this
woman as to where whereabouts of her husband and his health. walt
rogers is back with us. we've been in and out now for almost two
hours. what's happening with you and the 7th cav as we continue to
watch your image by way of video phone and the giant m1-a1 tank. walt,
good evening again.
