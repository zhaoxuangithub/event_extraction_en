SEOUL, South Korea (AP)

North Korea's military may have fired a laser at a U.S. helicopter in
March, a U.S. official said Tuesday, as the communist state ditched
its last legal obligation to keep itself free of nuclear weapons.

The aircraft's censors detected the unknown type of laser while it
was flying near the heavily fortified frontier that divides the two
Koreas, the U.S. military official said on condition of anonymity. No
one was injured and no equipment was damaged in the incident.

North Korea said Tuesday that a 1992 agreement with South Korea not
to deploy nuclear arms on the Korean Peninsula was nullified,
accusing the United States of derailing the deal.

``The inter-Korean declaration on denuclearization of the Korean
Peninsula was thus reduced to a dead document due to the U.S. vicious
hostile policy to stifle the DPRK with nukes,'' said the North's
official news agency, KCNA. DPRK stands for the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea, the North's official name.

The announcement came as U.S. President George W. Bush and South
Korean President Roh Moo-hyun were about to meet Wednesday in
Washington to discuss North Korea's nuclear programs.

The accord was the last remaining legal obligation under which North
Korea was banned from developing atomic arms. In January this year,
North Korea withdrew from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, a
global accord to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.

A U.S. military official in Seoul, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Tuesday North Korea is believed to have exported
US$580 million worth of missiles to Iran, Pakistan, Libya, Syria,
Egypt, Yemen and the United Arab Emirates in 2001.

In December, a shipment of North Korean missiles bound for Yemen was
briefly stopped in the Arabian Sea.

North Korea accuses the United States of planning to attack the
communist country, which Bush has branded part of an ``axis of evil''
along with Iran and Iraq. It also revived its claim that the U.S.
military keeps many nuclear weapons in South Korea, turning the
country into ``the biggest nuclear advance base in the Far East.''

Washington says it wants to use dialogue to resolve the nuclear
crisis, although U.S. officials have not ruled out a military option.

North Korea ``keenly felt that the denuclearization of the Korean
Peninsula would only remain as a daydream unless the U.S. drops its
hostile policy toward the DPRK,'' KCNA said.

It said the U.S. invasion of Iraq taught it that ``a war can be
averted and the sovereignty of the country and the security of the
nation can be protected only when a country has ... a strong military
deterrent force capable of decisively repelling any attack to be made
by any types of sophisticated weapons.''

In New York, South Korean President Roh said he will never condone
North Korea's nuclear development, but Seoul and Washington agree the
nuclear standoff with the North must be solved peacefully ``by all
means.''

``It is incumbent upon Pyongyang to give up its nuclear project and
come forward as a responsible member of the international
community,'' he said. ``When the North takes this route, the Republic
of Korea and the international community will extend the necessary
support and cooperation.''

Julianne Lee, a Roh spokeswoman, said the North Korean statement
might be a negotiating ploy in the wake of talks last month with U.S.
officials in Beijing.

During the talks in Beijing, U.S. officials said North Korea claimed
it already possesses nuclear weapons, and that it had reprocessed
8,000 spent nuclear fuel rods  _  a move that could yield several
atomic bombs within months.

North Korea offered to drop its nuclear and missile programs in
exchange for security guarantees and economic aid, according to U.S.
officials.

The nuclear crisis flared in October, when Washington said North
Korea admitted having a secret nuclear program in violation of a 1994
treaty with Washington.
