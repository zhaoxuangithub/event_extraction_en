House clearance Royal Marine style, troops from (UNINTELLIGIBLE) commando
task to seek out the last pockets of Iraqi resistance in Umm Qasr go in
hard to arrest suspected regime sympathizers and search for weapons. It's
not pretty and there's no please and thank you but for the Marines, every
door potentially hides a gunman and when your life is on the line,
manners go out the window. The Iraqis arrested looked bemused (ph) and
plead innocence but with many militia here, pretending to surrender only
to open fire on their captors later, first impressions can be deceptive
and lethal. This patrol did find hidden weapons. They're not the first
and they're unlikely to be the last. The Marines believe they have a firm
hold on Umm Qasr right now but they can't afford to slack in their grip
and allow those who are hostile to the coalition forces to regroup and
begin again their cycle of violence. The Marines with their snipers have
now snipers have now spread their area of operations north to include the
town of Umm Kiou (ph). As in Umm Qasr before it, they're here to clear
out the opponents to regime change. A man in this vehicle took a pot shot
at the commandos. It was a painful and bloody mistake.

We sent in one of our companies of about 100 men in here this morning and
we took about 12 or 13 prisoners, three or four enemy were injured and
they've now been flown out and we're treating them including a man who is
almost dead with a gunshot wound to the chest. We've now evacuated them
out and the enemy now have either fled or they've been captured.
