SOUTH OF BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP)

U.S. soldiers moved to capture Baghdad's Saddam International Airport
early Friday and fought running battles with Iraqi defenders along
the city's southern fringes. ``A vise is closing on the regime,''
U.S. President George W. Bush said.

Some frontline units went on heightened alert against the threat of
chemical weapons, ordered to wear rubber boots and suits despite
temperatures that soared into the 90s.

There was fierce fighting in Kut, to the south of Baghdad, where
desperate Iraqis armed with rifles charged tanks in a suicide raid.
``We mowed down'' the attackers, said Lt. Col. B.P. McCoy.

Despite declarations that more tough fighting lies ahead, the top
U.S. military official indicated there may not be an all-out battle
for Baghdad. Gen. Richard Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, suggested isolating members of the old regime in the capital 
_  cut off from the rest of the country  _  while an ``interim
administration'' is put in place to begin work on a postwar
government.

A meeting to organize an interim government could be held in Iraq
within a week, a senior Pentagon official said Thursday night.

For the first time in the war, large parts of Baghdad lost
electricity. The cause was not known. Myers told reporters at a
Pentagon briefing that Americans had not targeted the power grid.

Tracer rounds lit the night sky and artillery boomed near the airport
a few kilometers (miles) from the heart of President Saddam Hussein's
capital of 5 million people.

At one stage, it appeared that U.S. forces had taken control of the
airport, ``and then it got more confusing with continued fighting,
Myers said Thursday night. Capture of the airport would give American
and British troops a facility for airlifting equipment and troops to
Baghdad.

Along the city's southern edge, U.S. tanks and Bradley vehicles
destroyed at least seven Iraqi armored personnel carriers and more
than 15 Iraqi tanks in fighting that went on for more than four
hours.

Two weeks into the war, American commanders reported a string of
successes  _  on the battlefield and within an Iraqi population
initially reluctant about embracing invading troops. Kurdish fighters
in the north chipped in, when a top leader suggested they may agree
not to seek control of the northern city of Kirkuk.

There were battlefield setbacks, as well. Two Marines were killed and
one injured in the close-quarters fighting in Kut. And an Army
soldier investigating a destroyed tank in central Iraq was killed by
friendly fire when he was mistaken for an Iraqi, the military said.

U.S. defense officials also were investigating whether a Navy Hornet
jet that crashed Wednesday was shot down by a U.S. Patriot missile.
The Navy was searching for the pilot Thursday.

The overall toll of American troops dead passed 50, and Bush visited
a Marine camp, which has lost 13  _  more than any other
installation. ``He's in heaven,'' the commander in chief told the
family of one fallen Marine in a private moment.

To the cheers of thousands earlier in a speech, he vowed victory, and
said, ``A vise is closing on the regime.''

Iraqi officials issued the latest in a series of exhortations in
Saddam's name. ``Fight them with your hands. God will disgrace
them,'' they said, referring to invading American and British troops.

But the daily urgings seemed increasingly at odds with the military
situation across the country, and Myers said Saddam had lost control
of 45 percent of Iraq's territory.

As conventional units fought their way to the outskirts of the
capital, officials said special forces had raided the Tharthar
presidential palace near Tikrit, Saddam's hometown. Documents were
seized at the site north of Baghdad, said Brig. Gen. Vincent Brooks
at U.S. Central Command in the Persian Gulf, but no ranking members
of the regime were found.

``That's all right, he added, ``there's other operations ongoing.''

To the far north, U.S. special forces and Kurdish militiamen captured
the town of Bardarash and a nearby bridge, one of few routes into the
city of Mosul near government-held oil fields. Iraqis had held the
town for 13 years.

In the country's southern region, British forces penetrated closer to
the center of Basra, and warplanes dropped 500-pound (225-kilogram)
and 1,000-pound (450-kilogram) laser-guided bombs on an Iraqi
intelligence complex. Die-hard defenders have held out for days
inside the city of 1.3 million.

American officials cited continuing examples of Iraqis cooperating
with invading troops. In Najaf, they said a prominent cleric under
house arrest by the Iraqi government had urged the population not to
interfere with the operations of American or British forces.

A small group of Iraqi defenders has been holding out inside the city
in a mosque, considered a Shiite holy site, and local clerics said
one religious leader had recently arrived in hopes of arranging for
their safe passage out of the shrine.

Ground forces closed in on Baghdad from separate southern approaches,
the Army from the southeast and Marines from the southwest, in
advances begun Tuesday night.

American and British helicopters and planes bombed positions in Kut,
and Marines and Iraqis lobbed grenades at close quarters.

Between 10 and 15 Iraqis armed only with rifles charged Marine tanks
in the suicide charge. Two U.S. Marines died in the fighting  _  and
a medic who tried to save one of them sorrowfully buried his
resuscitation equipment on the spot.

Army forces rolled past dozens of dead Iraqi soldiers and bombed-out
hulks of Iraqi military equipment as they made their way toward
Baghdad from the area around Karbala. Many more Iraqi soldiers
surrendered to the overwhelming force of the Americans, and were
shuttled to the rear.

At the same time they worried about chemical weapons attacks, Brooks
disclosed that a special operations force in the southwestern desert
had found a number of bottles ``marked in strange ways.'' He said an
investigation was under way.
