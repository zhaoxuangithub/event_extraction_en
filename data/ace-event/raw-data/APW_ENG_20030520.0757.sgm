Australia to keep open its embassy in Saudi Arabia With

CANBERRA, Australia (AP)

Australia will keep open its embassy in Saudi Arabia despite
decisions by the United States, Britain and Germany to close their
diplomatic outposts in the country amid growing terror fears.

On the eve of a visit to the Saudi capital, Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer said security at the Australian embassy appeared to
be sufficient.

``We have quite a substantial security presence at the Australian
embassy in Riyadh and the ambassador thinks that that security
presence is sufficient,'' Downer told the Australian Broadcasting
Corp.

Australia is one of Washington's staunchest allies. Canberra sent
troops to fight in the war on terror in Afghanistan and alongside
U.S. and British forces in Iraq.

New Zealand also has no immediate plans to close its Saudi embassy.

On Tuesday, Saudi security officials said three suspected al-Qaida
militants were arrested in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, in sweeps following
the near-simultaneous suicide attacks on three residential compounds
on the outskirts of Riyadh on May 12. The bombings killed 34 people 
_  including nine attackers, eight Americans and two Britons  _  and
wounded nearly 200 others.

Earlier this week, Saudi and U.S. officials said they had new
intelligence pointing to Osama bin Laden's al-Qaida group possibly
launching fresh attacks in the United States or against American
interests overseas.
