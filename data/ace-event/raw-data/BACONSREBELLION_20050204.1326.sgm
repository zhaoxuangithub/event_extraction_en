Renowned UVA political scientist Larry Sabato this morning announced
a $1,000,000 cash gift to the University of Virginia. The gift, payable
over three years, is the largest ever given the university by an active
faculty member, according to UVA President John Casteen. Sabato has
written 23 books. Some of them have been read!

That's pretty darn generous. Was it HIS money?

I'm not ashamed to say that I'm in the tank for Professor Sabato. He
maintains his political independence as well as any pundit and this
donation affirms that the words he's always used to describe his
commitment to UVA are genuine. He could have moved on to any number of
tv or print opportunities, but has stayed in Charlottesville to continue
his good works.

I'd suggest Wahoos disenchanted with Pete Gillen rally around Sabato
as the embodiment of their university's excellence.
