Apparently Yuganskneftegaz, which was sold to an independent buyer
who turned out to be an apparatus of the state (yes, the same state that
1) forced Yukos to do the auction, and 2) ran the auction, not that 3)
this is suspicious or anything), and which was then being bought with
foreign assistance, is not being bought with foreign assistance. As of
this morning, at least. Anyway, it looks like they're denying Chinese
involvement to avoid a lawsuit , which is funny -- you'd think they
might know someone in the Russian judiciary who could help them out.
