So Oracle and Peoplesoft , who spent the last 18 months insulting one
another in every imaginable way, are finally tying the knot ? The final
price, $26.50 per share, beats all the previous bids by a huge margin --
of course, Oracle lowballed their earlier offers, and ended up basically
bidding against themselves and the optimism of other Peoplesoft
shareholders for a year and a half. It's been a pretty grueling fight
(was it worth it? How much of Peoplesoft's most valuable -- human --
resources will walk out the door the day their options vest?) made all
the more so by the widely-held assumption that Larry Ellison was either
bluffing or screwing around.

So it's over. I don't have Oracle/Peoplesoft's spat to kick around
anymore. I'll have to stick with condemning the merger as a totally
unworkable deal between two sides who absolutely hate each other. And I
won't dwell on the irony of an Oracle employee being driven out of
Oracle, starting his own company, and forcing Ellison to spend $10.3
billion to get his company -- but not him -- back (though it does rather
delightfully remind me of Coca-Cola basically giving away the bottling
franchise and then spending billions to buy it back). Ellison is
brilliant enough to make this merger work, but he's crazy enough to
wreck even the soundest of deals. We shall see.
