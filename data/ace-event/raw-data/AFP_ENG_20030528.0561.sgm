NEW YORK, May 28 (AFP)

Bankrupt energy giant Enron Corp is considering bringing legal action
against its own bankers for giving bad financial advice that helped
lead to its downfall, the Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday.

The Houston energy company, which has been the target of a slew of
investigations into alleged financial deception, filed a pair of
motions in federal bankruptcy court in Manhattan in April, said the
daily.

It added that the move is part of a new push under the leadership of
new chief executive officer Stephen Cooper to settle all the
litigation involving Enron and its bankers, shareholders and
creditors.

Enron's principal bankers, including JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup,
and along with numerous other Enron advisers, have already been sued
by the company's shareholders for allegedly helping the company hide
debt, and they face investigations from regulators over their
involvement.

Besides JP Morgan and Citigroup, the other Enron advisers include
Bank of America, CSFB, Merrill Lynch, UBS, Deutsche Bank, Goldman
Sachs, Lehman Brothers Holdings, ABN Amro, Barclays PLC, Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce, WestLB AG and National Westminster Bank
PLC, now part of Royal Bank of Scotland PLC.
