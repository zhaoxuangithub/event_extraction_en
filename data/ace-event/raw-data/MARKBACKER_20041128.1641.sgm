We have been on the go since about noon on Wednesday and even longer
in the wife's case. She started cleaning about a week before the holiday
and cleaned for about two weeks right thru the holiday.

We spent Friday doing a little shopping and got to bed early, but
Saturday was busy with football watching. The Irish suck. Not as a
people, but as a football team. The looked good for 15 minutes, but then
they got run over by Matt Leinert and USC. I have no beef with USC being
number one, but Oklahoma is nowhere close to number two in the country,
and I am sick of the pollsters who only look at East coast scores
instead of watching tape of the games. Auburn has trailed in exactly two
games this year, and has given up less than 9.5 points per game.
Oklahoma has given up bucketloads of points, but still gets some mystery
respect for it.

(I know many of you may be tired of my rants about this, have no
fear. It'll all be over by next Sunday night or Monday morning. At that
point, we're either in or fucked and either way, I'm writing about it
once then, and that will be it).

Anyway, we decided to go ahead and get a fake tree yesterday, and we
got that bad boy put up yesterday and are decorating it today. We also
got all of our exterior lights up today, marking the first time this
family has ever had their decorating done by Thanksgiving Sunday. Big
kudos to the missus.

It feels weird not watching racing today, but it'll get easier and
then, come January 10th or so, there'll be testing news and driver
signing news and we'll be on the back side of the remaining 84 days
until the Daytona 500.

Until tomorrow kids, WAR EAGLE!!
