now that saddam hussein's regime has fallen is democracy the answer to
iraq and its people. in his book, fareed zakar ericks a joins us now
to talk about democracy and iraq's future. good to see you.
</TURN>
<TURN>
thank you, paula.
</TURN>
<TURN>
good to see you on a different network for a change.
</TURN>
<TURN>
that's what happens when you sell books.
</TURN>
<TURN>
i know. let's talk about what barbara starr was reporting from the
pentagon. she says there is an acknowledgment from those officials
that there are not enough ground troops in place and particularly in
baghdad to control what our nic robertson is saying is a stage of
anarchy in some parts of iraq. do you think the administration
underestimated the day after?
</TURN>
<TURN>
i think because the day after came so fast and so suddenly in way. i
think that there's been a pattern here not just with this
administration, but over the last ten years, bosnia, kosovo,
afghanistan, where we don't quite recognize when the old order
collapses, you very quickly have to rush in and fill it with some kind
of new order. in the short-term, that's going to have to mean the
american military. but the key question, which i try to address in the
book, is what do you do after that? what kind of authority do you
create in a society going through this kind of transition.
</TURN>
<TURN>
and how do you know that the local iraqi citizens will make up this
government or, in fact, interested in democracy? there's no proof of
that.
</TURN>
<TURN>
well, the key here is the only way to get that kind of legitimate
government to have it look good is to hold elections. but if you hold
elections, you stop the whole process of building a rule of law,
creating courts, creating administration. we've seen in the past in
bosnia for example, you held elections and all of the old ethnic thugs
get into power because they have organization and they have money and
they stop the process of genuine building of democracy. there is this
tension here which is the only way to make this look good is in some
way get legitimate iraqi authority, but the faster you get that, the
more likely you stop this process.
</TURN>
<TURN>
so what do you think of this interim government? you got deputy
defense secretary paul wolfowitz saying that american and british
military forces would play a leading role in setting up an iraqi
government and then later draw civilians into the process. is that
going to work?
</TURN>
<TURN>
i think it will work if it's truly broad-based and truly consensual,
try and include all different people and including them in creating a
constitution which would take a few years. what i point out is the
plays where you've had quick transitions
