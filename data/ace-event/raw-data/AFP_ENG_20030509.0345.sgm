Budget cinema launched by eastJet founder finally gets some films

LONDON, May 9 (AFP)

A ground-breaking British budget cinema chain launched by the founder
of low-cost airline easyJet announced Friday that it had finally
acquired some films to show -- just a fortnight before it first
opens.

EasyCinema, which aims to sell tickets to its no-frills cinemas for
as little as 20 pence (0.28 euros, 0.32 dollars), has been locked in
a bitter battle with film distributors over how it wants to pay for
titles.

Rather than splitting ticket sales with distributors, easyCinema
wants to pay a fixed fee for rights to show first-run movies over a
fixed period, a proposal thus far rejected by the film majors.

EasyCinema founder Stelios Haji-Ioannou, who set up easyJet in 1995
and built it up into Europe's biggest budget airline, has vowed to
take legal action against the distribution firms unless they allow
him access.

The deadlock, and subsequent lack of any films, has been threatening
to de-rail the debut of easyCinema's first outlet in Milton Keynes,
just north of London, which is due to open its doors on May 23.

However the firm announced on Friday that it had reached a deal with
the British arm of French distributors Pathe to show four releases.

While not the latest Hollywood blockbusters, these include titles
such as as recently-released US martial arts picture "Bulletproof
Monk" and new British 1930s-based weepie "The Heart of Me".

Haji-Ioannou professed himself "delighted", but promised to push
ahead in his battle with other distributors.

"The situation with the top six UK distributors representing more
than 90 percent of the market is still in a deadlock," he said.

"I have instructed my lawyers to discuss this issue with the Office
of Fair Trading."

EasyCinema aims to make its money by drawing the public in with
rock-bottom prices during off-peak hours, when traditional cinemas
are often almost empty, also giving the biggest discounts to tickets
bought long in advance.

To cut costs, all booking is done via the Internet and the pared-down
cinemas have no popcorn stalls and skeleton staff.
