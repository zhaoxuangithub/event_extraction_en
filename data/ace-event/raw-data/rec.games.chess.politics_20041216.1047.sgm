Turns out the August 2003 crisis was not a crisis

Everyone has heard the story: Beatriz Marinello was elected USCF
President on August 11, 2003 in Los Angeles. Immediately after she
took office, she found out that the USCF had no money in the bank,
zero. The USCF did not even have the money to pay the guaranteed
prizes at the just concluded US Open in Los Angeles.

Therefore, on August 20, 2003, bravely Beatriz walked into the USCF
Offices in New Windsor and immediately fired 17 staff members. John
McCrary resigned from the board as a result.

Of course, it was just a pure coincidence that the 17 people Beatriz
fired were the people she had grown to dislike during the year that
she worked for the USCF in 1999-2000.

It took six weeks before the USCF paid the guaranteed prizes the prize
winners had won at the US Open.

I have just found out something that insiders had known for a long
time. The USCF did not have zero money in the bank. It had $85,000 in
another bank account that nobody knew about. This was not due to any
malfeasance. The office accountant for the USCF had set up a separate
bank account and had put the entry fees from the US Open into that
account. Nobody knew about that separate bank account, except for the
accountant herself.

When this was discovered, the accountant explained that she was
planning to keep the money in that account until the tournament was
closed out. Perhaps the accountant was following a procedure followed
by the USCF for scholastic tournaments. At scholastic tournaments, no
cash prizes are paid. However, in adult tournaments, the players
expect to receive their prizes, and to receive them immediately.

For this act of stupidity which had caused a grave crisis in the USCF,
the accountant was immediately fired.

Had the existence of this $85,000 in a secret bank account been known,
it would not have been necessary to fire those 17 people right away.
Perhaps in the long run it was a good thing to fire them, but it might
not have been a good idea to fire them all abruptly, in the same day.

Bullcrap. He was embarassed by how Niro misled him into thinking there would
be a surplus. He was asked to wait until after the LA meeting was over
before resigning.

Yes, Sam, you are correct. And I knew about it also.

I also knew about the $100,000+ of audit adjustments (and non-adjustments) for
inventory, unbilled advertising, newsstand sales, tournament revenues, pension
&amp;health insurance over-accruals, multi year membership revenue, etc. etc. that
I was too sick to argue with Linda and the auditors about. I knew that they
would get corrected as a matter of course during fiscal 2004 resulting in
understatement of 2003 income and overstatement of 2004. And, of course, that
is what happened. I just had no idea that the new Board would see it as
leverage to seize power and pummel the office staff.

Not only was there adequate cash put aside, we had approval for an equity loan
on the building to bridge the move. But I didn't want to pay the $10,000 points
and interest unless and until it was absolutely necessary. We also had a buyer
for the building at a prize much higher than it was eventually sold for and a
commitment for 4% bank financing in Crossville.

Staff reductions were clearly in the works pending system changes that would be
facilitated by any move, Miami, PBG, Crossville or elsewhere. To make the staff
cuts without the system changes was absurd and probably the reason for McCrary
&amp;Camaratta's departures.

When I offered to attend the Board meeting in October 2003 to explain and
clarify all this, I was told I was not welcome. I sat in New Windsor all
weekend waiting for a phone call so I could answer EB questions and shed light
on the situation. It is no coincidence that the employees let go included
substantially all those who had offered to transfer to Crossville, including
(remarkably) the employee of the year!

You can read all this in my book coming out next summer.

Thanks for seeing the truth for a change.

Best wishes to all,
Frank Niro
