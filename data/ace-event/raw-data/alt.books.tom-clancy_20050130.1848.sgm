It's A Great Day For The Iraqi People...And A Vindication For American
Foreign Policy And National Security Policy.

And It's A Great Day For President George W. Bush And His Vision,
Leadership, Excellent Management Talents, Endurance, Faith And
Intelligence.

Compare &amp; Contrast GWB's Vision, Leadership, Excellent Management
Talents, Endurance, Faith And Intelligence With LBJ's Lack Of Same In
The Vietnam War.

Teddy Kennedy hasn't a CLUE about THAT....

Don't Forget To Ridicule And Excoriate The Germans, the Russians, the
Chinese, the Left-Wing Spaniards And The Supine Appeasement-Oriented
American Left-Wing Democrats As Well -- NOT Just The French.

They All Fought AGAINST This Result Every Step Of The Way.

Let's see...

There two main qualities to be desired in a Commander-in-Chief,
Generalship and Leadership.

Because in the United States the Commander-in-Chief is a purely
political post, generalship is usually undertaken by the generals
proper under the Commander-in-Chief, provided it is understood that the
Commander-in-Chief is ultimately responsible and accountable for the
outcomes of his general's generalship.

Generalship involves the technical skills of intelligence gathering,
strategic and tactical planning, and the communication of orders.

Leadership can be less rigidly defined and is concerned less with
coordination than motivation and how a commander seeks to inspire his
men to fight harder and endure worse privations in order to beat the
enemy.

President Bush generalship has proven deficient. His planning for the
war was inadequate and his monitoring of the war after the invasion
failed to correct course in the face of the change in circumstances
brought by a strong and unexpected insurgency.

The Commander-in-Chief's generalship can suffice to motivate men if
they are higly confident that he is a very capable and skilled general.
Eisenhower was in that position. That has not been the case with
President Bush, who unleashed hell acting on faulty intelligence,
failed to find any WMD, and left our boys at war wanting for armor.
That is not the sort of generalship that on rational grounds alone
motivates men to march to possible death.

Men unmotivated by bad generalship can still be motivated by
exceptional leadership. In theory, motivation is best carried out by a
commander fighting alongside his men. Make no mistake, even when we
don't desire a president with a preference for personal combat, the
need for a commander to be seen to share dangers with his men is as
imperative today as it was in times of Alexander of Macedon. That's
why we look at the military record of our leaders. John Kennedy,
George H. Bush, and even John Kerry, the loser, had distinguished
military careers that were apt substitutes for leading men in battle.
The knowledge that the Commander-in-Chief once faced grave danger in
war bravely can be the animating spirit of troops facing the same
dangers.

George W. Bush has no distinguished military career. In fact, CBS and
carrier landings notwithstanding, there is every indication that in the
peak of youth he avoided the dangers of war as much as he could. That
is not the sort of leadership that on emotional grounds alone motivates
men to march to possible death.

Some might say that George W. Bush is neither a general nor a soldier,
he is a politician. He is in charge of Grand Strategy and he delegates
the rest.

True. But as Commander-in-Chief he is the Ultimate General and the
First Soldier.

George W. Bush, the Politician, is not very good at grand strategy
either. The aim of grand strategy is a prosperous and secure peace,
and by his several blunders over the psychology of his opponents, the
political and economic effects of his actions, and the failure to
erradicate terrorism and even capture he most wanted terrorist, George
W. Bush, he has failed to realize the aim of grand strategy.

I'll be glad if Iraq becomes a truly democratic country. But will it?
And at what price? Are you willing to pay with a deficit of billions,
thousands of Americans dead or badly wounded, and the unmeasurable
disruption that a foreign war causes to the life of our nation at all
levels, for each country in the world that is in the grip of a tyrant?
I am not. Let those countries grow a generation with the guts and the
willingness to originate democratic change and I'll support joining
other nations to back the ef. But unilaterally, or worse leading a
coalition featuring tyrannies, effect such change remains a bad idea,
Iraq's elections notwithstanding.

George W. Bush didn't do well in the industrial private sector where
success is measured by return on investment. Government suits such a
man perfectly; there is no balance sheet to worry about. There is
every indication that the new rulers of Iraq will do business as usual
under a democratic varnish. The interim government didn't hesitate to
torture opponents, just like Saddam did. the Shiites will be no
different. That will be our return on investment.

Iraq wields democracy like Britney Spears wields the electric guitar,
it looks cool and trendy but she has no idea of how to play it.
