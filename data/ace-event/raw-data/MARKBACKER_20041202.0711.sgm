Apparently Jason Giambi, recently the non-playing and "sick" first
baseman of the New York Yankees, admitted to a Grand Jury that he
"injected anabolic steroids and human growth hormone (HGH) as recently
as 2003. And he apparently got them thru BALCO and (surprise) the same
guy that is Barry Bonds' trainer, once Greg Anderson.

Since that Grand Jury testimony was given, Giambi repeatedly denied
using any steroids, HGH, or anything else to anyone and everyone that
would listen.

Jason's brother Jeremy also admitted to the grand jury that he used
steroids.

Now, Barry is denying he's done any steroids and Gary Sheffield's
denying he's done any steroids, but one by one, the lesser (and bigger)
players in this deal are seeing their testimony coming into the the
public eye where they admitted that they DID do steroids. It seems that
anyone associated with this special "trainer" Greg Anderson is coming up
dirty.

It's a good thing that Major League Baseball has such a tough steroid
policy, or this story may not have been brought to our attention.
(cough...cough...sarcasm...cough).

Never mind if the steroids and human growth hormones were illegal in
baseball or not. They are illegal to use in the United States. I want to
know where the Federal criminal charges against all parties involved
are. Anyone?

The fact that these guys (Sheff, the Giambis, Marion Jones, Bonds and
many others) are running around denying this shit and acting like Pete
Rose did any time someone asked him about gambling (getting uber
defensive, denying it implicitly and acting like the person asking had
personally assaulted him) is appalling. These clowns are messing with
people's careers by insisting they're being lied about, yet when it
turns out the reporters weren't lying and the athletes were, nothing is
done.

I have never denied that Barry Bonds was a special and gifted
athlete. Whether it's steroids, HGH, crank, lighter fluid or antifreeze
he's using, being able to perform at this level for this length of time
defies logic or reason. That's why it's a shame that, in the final
analysis, all of Bonds' numbers and accomplishments are going to be
ignored and lumped into the statement "yeah, but he was on steroids."
It's a pity he and the others are too dumb to see that.

And now, just so you don't think that every entry in this blog will
be like the one above, here's a great joke I read today:

A man takes his Rottweiler to the vet and says, "My dog's cross-eyed,
is there anything you can do for him? "

"Well," says the vet, "let's have a look at him."

So he picks the dog up and examines his eyes, then checks his teeth.

Finally, the vet says "I'm going to have to put him down."

"What? Because he's cross-eyed?"

"No, because he's really heavy."

I will be breaking down the SEC championship game either later today
or tomorrow, so I expect you all to be planted firmly on the edge of
your seats waiting for that one.

War Eagle everybody!
