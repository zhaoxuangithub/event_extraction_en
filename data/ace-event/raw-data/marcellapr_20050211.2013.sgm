Howdy,

Lauren Rouse here. I'm in charge of getting everyone excited about
contacting organizations so Marcella can meet with them. Next week we
want to have as many dates as possible set up for her as we can, so we
are asking y'all to please talk to your organizations to see if they
would be interested in having Marcella come and speak. In the near
future we will be expanding this to include all the other
organizations that we can contact, but we are just keeping things safe
for now. If you are interested in helping out with contacting
organizations then please let me know, cause I need all the help I can
get. There are 6 sub committees under the organizations committee:

Greek (2)

Department of Multicultural services (Tasha should have this taken
care of)

MSC (2, but I think Crystal is taking care of some of this but she
still will need some help)

Student Activities (3)

Academics and colleges (2)

International (1)

I am going to need that number of people to help with contacting
people in these areas, so please let me know asap.


So, as I said earlier please just stick to contacting your
organizations this weekend and friends you may have in other
organizations. I have attached the welcome packet info if they are
interested and I have the cheat sheet to use as a guideline for when
you talk to them (just in case you don't have them yet). Remember to
stress that Marcella can either meet with the execs or the whole group
(whatever works best), that she will be talking briefly, and that she
will be there because she wants to learn about that group's concerns
and issues at A&amp;M. Don't say anything like "vote for Marcella" or
"support Marcella" cause we don't want anyone to get in trouble.

If they are interested in setting up a meeting then have them contact
me at 979-777-6445 or at laurouse...@yahoo.com and I will send the
info to Tori, or have them contact Tori Foster to set up a time.

Also, let me know who you have already contacted and set up a meeting
with so that I can make sure we don't call them twice.

Ok guys, sorry for the long e-mail and the rambling, but I want to
make sure that I have everything covered. And if you have any
questions feel free to contact me at the numbers, addresses above.

Thanks y'all! Have a great weekend!

Lauren
