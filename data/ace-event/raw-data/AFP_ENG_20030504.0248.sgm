TEHRAN, May 4 (AFP)

The pro-reform director of Iran's biggest-selling daily newspaper and
official organ of Tehran's municipality has stepped down following
the appointment of a conservative as the city's new mayor, press
reports said Sunday.

Mohammad Atrianfar, who had headed Hamshahri (Fellow Citizen) since
it was founded a decade ago and was a major backer of reformist
President Mohammed Khatami, explained that he wanted to "leave the
new mayor with a free hand to choose a director" of the paper.

Tehran had been governed by reformists since 1989, but a conservative
city council was elected in the February 28 municipal polls in a
result attributed to a meager turnout amid growing public
disillusionment with electoral politics.

Mahmud Ahmadi-Nejad, reported to be a hardliner among conservatives,
was appointed mayor on Saturday and a change in Hamshahri's
management -- as well as its editorial line -- has been considered
inevitable given the election result.

Founded by former mayor Gholamhossein Karbaschi, Hamshahri was quick
to become Iran's biggest-selling daily with a circulation of 450,000.
It also built up healthy finances, carrying scores of pages of
private advertisements daily.
