Look at Latest Evidence Against Iraq; Any Hope U.N., Old Europe will 
Come Around to Bush Administration's Way of Thinking?

<SPEAKER> PAUL BEGALA, CNN CO-HOST </SPEAKER>
Hello, everybody. Welcome to CROSSFIRE. On this Ash Wednesday, the pope
asks Catholics to fast for peace and he asks President Bush to work for
peace, while the White House sends out Colin Powell to make yet another
case for war. We will debate all of that as well as "Vanity Fair"'s
latest, stunning revelations about Michael Jackson. Believe it or not, we
got new news on Michael Jackson. Do you think he really looks like a
mummy? Certainly not a daddy. But first, our own little moonwalk across
the political landscape, the "CROSSFIRE Political Alert." The foreign
ministers of France, Germany and Russia today issued a joint declaration
that they will not allow a second American-backed resolution to pass the
United Nations Security Council. President Bush wants the Security
Council to explicitly authorize force against Iraq, and his press
secretary today remained optimistic that in the end, that's just what
he'll get. President Bush is said to be focusing on one fence-sitting
Security Council member, the African nation of Guinea, because he said --
quote -- "I used to have one of their pigs." So -- OK, I made that up. He
didn't say that.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> TUCKER CARLSON, CNN CO-HOST </SPEAKER>
Well, I suspected that. You know...
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> BEGALA </SPEAKER>
But they are a swing vote. Guinea is an important swing vote.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> CARLSON </SPEAKER>
As is Cameroon. France and Germany are pointing to inspection and saying,
Look, they're working. We don't need war. They're not pointing out that
inspections are working only because there's the credible threat of war.
Saddam wouldn't be destroying missiles unless he thought he was going to
be destroyed if he didn't.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> BEGALA </SPEAKER>
I think that's a good point. It doesn't mean we have to go to war. But I
think President Bush should get credit for pushing to instructions and
backing them up with the threat of force.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> CARLSON </SPEAKER>
It means when you take the threat of force of the table, you're likely to
stop disarming Saddam Hussein.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> BEGALA </SPEAKER>
Yes, I'm not saying take the threat of force. I'm saying we don't need to
use force right now.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> CARLSON </SPEAKER>
Well, France and Germany would like to. Secretary of State Colin Powell
today responded to Saddam Hussein's latest attempts to fool the world.
Powell called Iraqi steps toward disarmament -- quote -- "too little, too
late" gestures, meant to split international resolve to force Baghdad to
give up its weapons of mass destruction. U.S. intelligence said Powell
indicates Iraq has hidden equipment to produce al-Samoud 2 missiles, even
as it destroys existing ones, missiles that until recently, it claimed
not to have. Powell also revealed that Iraq is hiding chemical and
biological weapons in poor neighborhoods around Baghdad. In order to
secure peace, Powell concluded, the international community must confront
Saddam Hussein's refusal to disarm -- quote -- "here and now." So, there
you have it. The essence of the American case for war against Saddam
Hussein. The only question left: who do you believe? Secretary of State
Colin Powell or France?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> BEGALA </SPEAKER>
No, the question is...
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> CARLSON </SPEAKER>
That is the question.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> BEGALA </SPEAKER>
Who do you believe: the Bush administration or your lying eyes? We are
watching them destroy weapons, as the president says, Oh, that's just a
hoax.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> CARLSON </SPEAKER>
But Paul...
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> BEGALA </SPEAKER>
They are disarming.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> CARLSON </SPEAKER>
No, no, no that's not what the president's saying. He's saying, the --
it's a hoax to the extent that those are only a small number of the
weapons there. Keep in mind, these are weapons that Saddam Hussein, until
recently, said he didn't even have. He's a liar.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> BEGALA </SPEAKER>
Of course.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> CARLSON </SPEAKER>
And to trust Saddam Hussein in effort to disarm him -- foolish task,
don't you think?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> BEGALA </SPEAKER>
Absolutely. Nobody trusts Saddam Hussein. The question is, Is he a
sufficient threat to America today to risk the lives of our young men and
women.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> CARLSON </SPEAKER>
That's a separate question. That's a very separate question.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> BEGALA </SPEAKER>
I think he's not. I think the inspections can work.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> CARLSON </SPEAKER>
That's a different argument. We can take it up later.
