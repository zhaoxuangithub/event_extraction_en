Pakistani Christian gets life imprisonment for blasphemy

MULTAN, Pakistan, April 27 (AFP)

A Pakistani court in central Punjab province has sentenced a
Christian man to life imprisonment for a blasphemy conviction, police
said Sunday.

Judge Shahid Rafiq, of the district court in the industrial city of
Faisalabad, found Ranjha Masih guilty of defiling Koranic verses
during a protest rally by the minority Christian community in 1998.

In a verdict handed down on Saturday, the judge also ordered Ranjha
to pay a fine of 50,000 rupees (about 870 US dollars), they said.

Ranjha was accused of tearing down a billboard carrying verses from
the Koran in Faisalabad during a Christian demonstration after the
city's bishop committed suicide over the 1985 blasphemy law.

Faisalabad's Catholic Bishop John Joseph, who had been campaigning
against the law, shot himself in the head outside a court in Sahiwal
district when the judge convicted Christian Ayub Masih under the law
in 1998.

Ayub Masih was charged in 1996 with blasphemy for allegedly defending
British author Salman Rushdie, whose novel "The Satanic Verses"
infuriated radical Mulsim clerics who accused the author of defaming
Islam.

The Pakistani supreme court last year aquitted Ayub Masih, who had
denied uttering any word against Islam or the Prophet Mohammad.

Blasphemy is punishable by death under the Pakistan Penal Code.
However, no blasphemy convict has ever been executed in the country.

Christian rights activists campaigning against the laws, introduced
by late military dictator General Zia-ul Haq, say they are mainly
used to persecute Christians or to settle feuds over land.
