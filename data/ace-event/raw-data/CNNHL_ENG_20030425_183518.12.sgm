was hoping to free a key september 11th suspect. the gunman is accused
of commandeering the bus in the north german city of bremen and
holding 16 people hostage during a 75-mile police chase down the
autobahn. negotiators say he demanded the release of four prisoners,
including ramzi binalshibh, a september 11th suspect apprehended last
year in pakistan. police captured the 17-year-old hijacking suspect
without firing a shot. all hostages were released unharmed.
