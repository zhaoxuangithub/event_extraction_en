</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Alexander </SPEAKER>

</TURN>
<TURN>

</TURN>
<TURN>

Go a- go ahead, you can talk about your previous work place.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Bill </SPEAKER>
Yeah, wh- -- Yeah, I was going to ask you where you work, too.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Alexander </SPEAKER>
I work with a pharmaceutical company. I we -- have a little over three
hundred and some ((million)) employees.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Bill </SPEAKER>
Oh wow.  And what do you do there?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Alexander </SPEAKER>
You know.  I work as a patient care advocate. And I -- I work as an
onli- I do online, you know, online, uh, pharmaceutical company -- where
I have -- filled and -- refilled take orders sent back to us online.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Bill </SPEAKER>
Oh, okay. That's interesting.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Alexander </SPEAKER>
And, you know,  and I have a company, as well, set up. I think we have
the account manager, and we have -- the vice president. We have super-
team lead- team leads, uh I and then have operations specialist. We
have, you know, I -- team managers, training managers. It's a very big
company. Yeah, and I think that the atmosphere is very good, I
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Bill </SPEAKER>
Right.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Alexander </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Bill </SPEAKER>
Well, I think that's important to to have a good atmosphere and also,
uh,  uh, i- know who who really is in charge,  uh, you know, and and
know who you have to answer to.  Because sometimes, y- I I I did I
years ago I had a company that was, uh,  it was,  uh, I was a subs- s-
captive sub-contractor for making packaging material.  And, um,  there
were a lot of salesmen in the company,  they had a tendency to,  you
know, there was there was, uh, a chain of command, you might say. You
know, there was, uh, the person that was the, uh,  head of the
organization.  But, all the salesmen -- used to come around and give
orders, too, you know.  So it made it kind of difficult for the m-
for my employees, because they would the salesmen would be coming out,
uh,  uh, without consulting with the one that was in charge.  They
would just be coming out and giving orders when they should already
went through him.  So it made it difficult.  So I I I think it's
really important to h- have that really clear.  That that there's some
organized way to deal with, uh,  problems and orders and things like
that, and if there is a problem, then -- you go to the person who's in
charge and -- then they can handle it.  So, that was -- that that's just a
you know, a -- previous, uh,  type of work that I had.  And I and tha- I
think that's what they wanted us to talk about, too, right?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Alexander </SPEAKER>
Yeah. Yeah, that's that's that's I think it's just basically, is (())
one of the things I perceive is if- what kind of, you know,
environment is it, and is it inviting is it, you know, all that they I
guess that's what they're aiming at.  You know, it's not a place where
everybody trying to give instruction and everybody trying to do, you
know.  Uh, but I for my job is i- i- -- we have us a very diverse feel.
We have a lot of people who are from different country, and,  you
know, and -- I think they are pretty much accepting, and I,  you know,
I- bas- basically you- you can promote yourself if you do a good job,
I mean,  they don't pick and choose, you know.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Bill </SPEAKER>
Right.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Alexander </SPEAKER>
It's a very -- environment that allows you to grow in.  And I think they
thinks I rightfully don't, if -- like if I have a problem, like,  I'll
freshly go to my team lead or the supervisor and she takes it to her
boss, and,  you know, the boss takes it to the next level and,  you
know, something like that.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Bill </SPEAKER>
Right.  Yeah, but that -- I feel like that that's very important. Uh,
for a company to be well-run, it has to have, uh,  a c- it's t- has to
be able to send a clear message -- as to how to handle problems and who
who is the one that's uh,  uh, indicated for -- for those problems -- to
handle.  And and people -- those in the company need to be um
instructed -- to know wh- where their relative place is in the company.
So that they they don't overstep their bounds.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Alexander </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Bill </SPEAKER>
Because when that happens, and it that makes, uh, that creates
problems for the employees. It makes them discontent.  I mean, if they
if they can be, eh, um,  you know, jumped on arbitrarily by just about
anybody,  then pretty soon, you know, they're they're they're not
going to be content at all, they're just going to wonder, well when
when's the next hit going to come, you know.  When's somebody else
going to jump on me?
