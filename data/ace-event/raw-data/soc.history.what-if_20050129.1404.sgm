<SUBJECT> The 1860 Presidential Election </SUBJECT>

In 1860 there was a four-way race between the Republican Party with Abraham
Lincold, the Democratic Party with Stephen Douglas, the Southern Democratic
Party with John Breckenridge, and the Constitutional Union Party with John
Bell. Lincoln won a plurality with about 40% of the vote.
WI it was only a two-way race between Lincoln and Douglas? I believe Douglas
would have won.
This would have delayed secession and the Civil War.

"One feature of the result must not be omitted. Many careless observers
felt at the time that the success of Lincoln was due entirely to the
fact of there having been three opposing candidates in the field; or,
in other words, to the dissensions in the Democratic party, which
divided its vote between Breckinridge and Douglas. What merely moral
strength the Democratic party would have gained had it remained
united, it is impossible to estimate. Such a supposition can only be
based on the absence of the extreme Southern doctrines concerning
slavery. Given the presence of those doctrines in the canvass, no
hypothesis can furnish a result different from that which occurred. In
the contest upon the questions as they existed, the victory of Lincoln
was certain. If all the votes given to all the opposing candidates had
been concentrated and cast for a 'fusion ticket,' as was wholly or
partly done in five States, the result would have been changed nowhere
except in New Jersey, California, and Oregon; Lincoln would still have
received but 11 fewer, or 169 electoral votes--majority of 35 in the
entire electoral college." Abraham Lincoln, A History, Volume 2
by John George Nicolay and John Hay

See for a
confirmation of the electoral arithmetic: the states where Lincoln got an
abolute majority of the popular vote (i.e., all the free states except Oregon,
California, and New Jersey) were sufficient to bring him a majority in the
Electoral College. The reason that Lincoln could get an electoral majority
with only forty percent of the popular vote was not that his opposition was
divided but that he had far fewer "wasted" votes than his opponents--in ten
southern states he got no popular votes at all.

It can of course be argued that the candidate of a united anti-Lincoln
opposition might have done better than all the OTL anti-Lincoln candidates
combined, because the mere fact of the divided nature of Lincoln's
opposition might have discouraged anti-Lincoln men and led to fewer of
them voting than would otherwise be the case. But given that turnout was
quite high in 1860, I doubt this.

One thing seems reasonably clear to me: if there was to be a united anti-
Lincoln opposition, Douglas could not lead it. He was hated too much in
the South for his opposition to the admission of Kansas as a state under
the pro-slavery Lecompton Constitution and for his interpretation of Dred
Scott as still allowing territories to exclude slavery through unfriendly
local legislation. (See

for Douglas's defense of his position.) He and Breckinridge and Bell would
have to withdraw in favor of a compromise candidate--former governor
Horatio Seymour of New York was one proposal. But I doubt that Seymour
would have been able to do better than all the combined OTL anti-Lincoln
candidates in such close states as Illinois and Indiana And his own
state of New York was not really close enough for me to believe he could
have taken that state from the Lincoln column.

Whether it was Lincoln vs. Douglas or Lincoln vs. Fusion Candidate,
wouldn't a candidate having won the Electoral College vote with only 40%
of the popular vote have provoked protests anyhow?
