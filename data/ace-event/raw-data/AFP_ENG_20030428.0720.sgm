NKorea offers to scrap nuke, missile programs but wants big
concessions: US

by Matthew Lee

ATTENTION - UPDATES ///

WASHINGTON, April 28 (AFP) - North Korea has offered to scrap its
nuclear weapons and missile programs, but only in return for
"considerable" diplomatic, political and economic concessions, the
United States said Monday.

Secretary of State Colin Powell said the offer was made during
three-way talks between US, North Korean and Chinese diplomats last
week in Beijing.

At the same meeting Pyongyang confirmed it had nuclear weapons, and
threatened to prove it with a "display."

"The North Koreans acknowledged a number of things that they were
doing and, in effect, said that these are now up for further
discussion," he told reporters at the State Department.

"They did put forward a plan that would ultimately deal with their
nuclear capability and their missile activities, but they, of course,
expect something considerable in return," Powell said.

"We are studying that plan, we are examining it with our friends and
allies," Powell said, adding that talks were now underway with the
South Korean, Japanese, Russian and Australian as well as other
governments.

"It was useful to get it all out on the table and see where we go
from here," he said, referring to the April 23 to 25 discussions in
Beijing.

Powell gave no indication as to whether Washington would accept the
offer, and did not address what Pyongyang was demanding in terms of
concesssions.

However other US officials said the North Koreans had presented a
lengthy list of demands.

The demands include full normalization of ties with the United
States, security guarantees and economic assistance that include oil
and other energy considerations.

"They had quite a list of things," State Department spokesman Richard
Boucher told reporters.

Asked specifically about normalization of relations and economic
assistance, Boucher replied: "I don't really quibble with that
characterization of the list."

A senior State Department official said later that the list of
demands was so extensive that it defied a "concise description."

"It basically listed everything they have ever asked for," the
official told reporters on condition of anonymity, identifying oil
and energy supplies as demands.

Although the North Korean demands are being looked at, Boucher
repeated long-standing US policy that Washington would not be
blackmailed or otherwise threatened into buying Pyongyang off.

"We've made clear we're not going to pay for elimination of the
nuclear weapons programs that never should have begun in the first
place," he said.

Powell acknowledged that North Korea had hinted it could prove it
possessed nuclear weapons with some sort of display during the
Beijing talks, but maintained that the North Koreans had not used the
words "test" or "testing."

"They said that it is the kind of capability that one can display in
one way or another," he said.

The concessions demanded by Pyongyang were part of a "bold" proposal
for addressing the nuclear situation on the Korean peninsula that
North Korea presented in Beijing, officials said.

South Korean newspapers reported earlier Monday that the North
suggested that Pyongyang and Washington act simultaneously and
equally to resolve the six-month-old nuclear crisis.

Boucher ruled out simultaneous steps by both sides, stressing that
Washington would not consider such moves until the "verifiable and
irreversible termination" of the north's nuclear programs.

"We (have) made clear that once North Korea did that, we could move
on or move back to the comprehensive approach to US-North Korea
relations that we had talked about before," he said.

South Korea's Munhwa Ilbo newspapers and others quoted unnamed South
Korean government sources as saying Pyongyang also urged Washington
not to hinder its efforts to establish and improve ties with Seoul
and Tokyo.

The North's ruling Workers Party newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, indicated
Sunday that North Korea wanted economic and political "rewards" from
the United States in return for the elimination of its nuclear
program.

Rodong called for a "fair and equal" footing in talks with the United
States, blasting Washington for insisting that there would be "no
security of the system nor provision of rewards" even if Pyongyang
gave up its nuclear program.

It insisted North Korea could do "everything" to defend itself if the
United States "legally guarantees no use of arms including nukes".
