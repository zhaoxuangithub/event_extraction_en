The market didn't have an intelligent way to react to this news
(except to send NASDAQ , which I've been cheerleading for a while, up
10.46% in sympathy), but the New York Stock Exchange may actually
convert to a for-profit entity. It's far too clubby now, and while this
move wouldn't get rid of nine-figure paydays, it might ensure that they
only happen when well-deserved. Not to name names or anything. The
exchange needs this: it's ossified, the real owners -- holders of
exchange seats -- have seen their investment lose 40% in a year (though
they can still earn an income from it to offset the losses), and the
NASDAQ has undercut their traditional dominance among growth
companies-turned-blue chips. Heck, they're down to just over half of
their single-letter symbols ! It's a dying organization, and this will
be just the jolt it needs for another couple decades of somnambulant
staggering before being ultimately replaced by far more efficient
companies.

Full Disclosure: "Far more efficient companies," basically means "The
NASDAQ," so take it with a gigantic grain of salt.

Secondary Disclosure: You can take the above at face value; I don't
own stock in a salt company.

Everything comes with lots of grains of salt. Ever read the label on
a soup can? It's amazing they can squeeze any liquid in there. And if
you crumble up crackers in there, that's even more salt.

Well, I'm not sure how I take the NYSE news. I think I agree with you
on the wreckless compensation thing. I also think that Sears-Kmart
should come up with a new name altogether. Those stores are deadzones,
and they need some buzz. Change the names, paint the buildings,
reorganize a little, and hire strippers for cashiers. I'm not sure how
that last idea got in there. Must be friday.
