<SUBJECT> Re: War with Iran </SUBJECT>

Ok, so if Iran is saying that they are moving forward with their
nuclear programs for science and friendly nuclear energy, why is the US
so worried? They are just trying to produce energy, as we have several
nuclear power plants. And all the demands to Syria...this all seems so
predictable. And if you were wondering, this is the link I got that
from...

I like this quote the best, but I am sure it means nothing to us (us
being the US's powers that be)..."The Iranian nation is not looking for
war, violence and confrontation," Khatami said. Well guess what
Khatami, you're in for it.

About 3 days ago I said to my wife....."shit in the world is going to
get ugly fast."  And although I wish we wouldn't have to do this....we
may have to flex our muscle again soon.  I think we are screwed with
N. Korea, but Syria and Iran are really testing us.  Syria's move in
Lebanon may cause them to get their ass handed to them soon.

please. this is a cop-out response. the reason we are so worried is
because we are on a higher level than 90% of the world because we have
nucler weapons. if countries we don't like start developing nuclear
weapons-grade material it makes us nervous. although so far, iran has
shown that they are *not* producing weapons-grade material and are in fact
using their nuclear power for just that, according to the IAEA. but when
you have a sitting president who has an infatuation with provoking other
countries into a war, you can bet that he will try everything he can to
try to prove his case against iran.

maybe because oil is a much bigger polluting source of energy than
nuclear? or maybe because it's more cost effective for them to use
nuclear than any other method? why should they run their energy supply
off of one of their backbone industries when oil is worth more to them on
the open market?

we are definitely trying to do too many things at once, but syria has been
fucking with the lebanese since before we came along. it's only becoming
more noticeable because there is so much *more* focus on the middle east
right now than ever before.

it's not a question of whether i believe iran is telling the truth. the
question was asked: why is the US scared of iran, and your response was
"because they're lying". this is a cop-out because you're not really
proving anything, you're just making accusations without proof.

ok, they made a very very small amount of a material that could maybe be
used in a weapon if they had more of it possibly. but the fact is that
iran is cooperating with most of the international community on this
issue, whether your believe them or not.

    "/>

this was about nuclear proliferation, not iraq's insurgency. i think that
if they have proof of iran's assistance to iraqi insurgents that it can be
dealt with later, once iraq is secure and able to handle its own affairs.
for now, we were talking about the iranian nuclear program, not iraq.

if you choose to believe them, that is your choice. i'll go with the

not if you have a meltdown or need to get rid of spent fuel rods. also, i

syria has occupied lebanon, they are in violation of security council
resolution 1559 stating that there should be no foreign forces in lebanon
and that lebabon should be allowed to have free elections. our alliance
to them is supporting people that want to have a free democratically

    "/>

finish the statement: then we will refer them to the security council.

what exactly is wrong with that? that is the type of diplomatic solution
that all of the anti-war people wanted for iraq. of course a whole bunch
of resolutions did nothing in iraq, but who knows, maybe this time they
will work.

personally, based on the aggressive stance they have taken and the way
they are helping the insurgency in iraq, i tend to not believe them when
they say that they aren't looking for a confrontation.
