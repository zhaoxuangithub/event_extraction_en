Russia hints "peace camp" alliance with Germany and France is dying

MOSCOW, April 13 (AFP)

Russian President Vladimir Putin's summit with the leaders of Germany
and France may have been a failure that proves there can be no
long-term "peace camp" alliance following the end of war in Iraq,
government sources were quoted as saying at the weekend.

"Senior government officials, speaking in the corridors of power in
Moscow, have no illusions about any long-term perspectives for the
(Russian-German-French) axis," the respected Izvestia daily reported.

"Sooner or later Iraq will fall and Russia and the United Sates will
resume normal relations," the senior Moscow official, who was
reported to be close to Putin, told the paper.

"The situation in Iraq does not mean that we intend to get into an
argument with the United States."

The comments indicate that Russia's nuanced position over the war in
Iraq was becoming ever more scrambled, with Putin pushing to protect
his budding friendship with US President George W. Bush in the face
of strident opposition from the Russian media and other top Kremlin
officials.

Analysts have long argued that Putin is far keener to preserve
friendly relations with the United States than the pro-European,
anti-war camps embedded in much of the Russian media and the foreign
and defense ministries.

Russia's foreign minister expressed outrage at suggestions from a top
Washington official last week that Moscow should forgive the eight
billion dollars in Soviet-era debt that Baghdad owes it, as a gesture
of good will.

Kommersant business daily joined in, declaring in a furious
front-page headline: "The United States is demanding that Russia,
France and Germany pay for the Iraqi war."

And the popular Gazeta.ru news website stormed: "We should have
expected this!.. This is only the start of a massive US campaign (to
decide Iraq's future finances)."

Yet Putin has been far more reserved. He and his loyal finance
minister suggested Friday that Moscow might be prepared to waiver
some of the Iraqi debts in return for better Russia-US relations.

"On the whole the proposal is understandable and legitimate," Putin
said. "Russia has no objections to such a proposal."

Putin concluded his two days of talks in Saint Petersburg with
Jacques Chirac of France and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder on
Saturday still urging for a central role for the United Nations in a
post-war revival of Iraq.

The call reflected the insistent demand made by the three leaders
before the US-British invasion of Iraq that UN approval was essential
for any mission to topple Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.

But the Saint Petersburg summit ended without any formal declaration
on Iraq.

And diplomats noted that Putin appeared uncomfortable at being so
closely associated with the anti-Washington stance of Schroeder and
Chirac amid his developing friendship with Bush.

Putin had even secretly invited British Prime Minister Tony Blair,
Bush's staunchest backer in the war on Iraq, to attend the pow-wow in
Saint Petersburg's Grand Hotel Europe, although diplomats said Blair
turned the offer down.

It remains to be seen how successful Putin's overtures to Washington
will be in the face of the fervent internal hostility to the US war
stance.

A senior lawmaker seen as close to the Kremlin ridiculed the United
States Sunday for failing to find any weapons of mass destruction in
Iraq.

"We do not think that America won," said Dmitry Rogozin, the head of
the lower house of parliament's foreign affairs committee, told
Rossia television.

"Where are those chemical weapons?" he demanded.

And Putin's media aide, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, told Kommersant Russia
would not forgive the Iraqi debt.

"(Washington) should not be so generous at other people's expense,"
he said.
