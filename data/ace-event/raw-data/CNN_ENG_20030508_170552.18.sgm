"vanity fair's" come lumist daniel fair is here. quiting in
the june edition, he describes the journey. he said he
found evidence that hussein's day of reckoning well over
due. christopher hitchens joins us from california. good to
have you with us.
</TURN>
<TURN>
thanks for having me.
</TURN>
<TURN>
your journey, particularly to southern iraq, what is evoked
there a sense of both that you evoke is a sense of history
of this regime. give us your insights as to what you think
the future holds.
</TURN>
<TURN>
do you mean if i start with the past?
</TURN>
<TURN>
not at you will. not at all i.
</TURN>
<TURN>
not much of a trip. i wasn't up the sharp end. i wasn't
taking risks. i wasn't in a position that my dear friend
was in when he was killed outside bagdad airport but i had
long thought and i was in iraq in the previous war that
really all the talk that had been about the rush to war,
the push for war, the drive for war, all that propaganda,
was essentially nonsensical because in 1990, saddam hussein
made the only self criticism. he said, i could either
invade kuwait or finish developing the nuclear weapon.
maybe before the weapon and then later he said, oh, i
should have got the nuclear weapon before i invaded. he was
right about that. but that means that he inaugurated at
that point like a dozen-year's war where the united states
could be criticized for doing too little and acting too
slowly but all we're arguing about lately is to do with
those that should have been finished in '91 when it could
have been finished. should have taken the side of the
rebels then. taken the risk of supporting a shiite
insurrection at that point. helping the kurds, removing the
regime.
</TURN>
<TURN>
absolutely.
</TURN>
<TURN>
we'd be 11 years into nation building by now if we'd done
that. that seems to be the core of the argument.
</TURN>
<TURN>
as you point out, of course, for the fact of the matter is,
the mistakes of saddam hussein made possible his removal
from power ultimately. the mistakes of the united states,
again, as you point out, norman schwarzkopf making a peace,
permitting helicopters to fly.
</TURN>
<TURN>
still hurts me to read this. the little town i was in this
southern iraq, as far as i got, i can't boast of further,
is where the talks took place. we have the transcript of
the meeting. they say, okay, we have lost this round. do
you mind if we keep your helicopters in the air just to be
able to transport things? and he says, yeah, that's all
right. they ask again, are you sure they mean that? they
can't believe the luck. they use the gunships to kill, we
think, not less than 50,000 inhabitants of southern iraq
and trying to do that to the kurds, as well, so it was a
knife edge. and it's not just been wise after the event, i
believe, to say that there was an argument in realtime
between the bush administration members. mr. cheney's the
only one i know that changed his mind. most of those that
took the view at that time, think until recently they were
correct in saving saddam hussein.
</TURN>
<TURN>
of course, mr. cheney was in the chain of command with
swars cough and --
</TURN>
<TURN>
many others.
</TURN>
<TURN>
when they made the decision not to move toward bagdad with
bad information. namely, the republican guard absolutely
devastated.
</TURN>
<TURN>
yes. and, well, we know now the harvest of all that. it
hurts to think of how many wonderful people in iraq at the
academic community, lawyers, human rights activists,
civilians, intellectuals, people -- would now be alive. who
have been horribly murdered and tortured and reduced to
misery since by a half application of violence through
sanctions and overflights.
</TURN>
<TURN>
mistakes made then, mistakes part of human experience, but
now we have an opportunity not to make mistakes. is it your
sense that the united states is on the right track? that
there is the prospect here a commitment here on the part of
the united states to
