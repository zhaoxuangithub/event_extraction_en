The Food and Drug Administration is considering whether to make
morning-after birth control available without a prescription. The FDA
may decide as soon as this week whether drug stores can sell the
emergency contraception known as Plan B without a prescription to women
age 16 and older.

Here is where I break with my conservative base and support the
availability of Plan B which can prevent pregnancy for up to 72 hours
after sex. With an 89% success rate, we can be optimistic that we are on
the right path to ending unwanted pregnancy that doesn't involve a
scalpel or suction tube.

Conservatives say people will be less reluctant to have risky and
unprotected sex if they've got a box of B under the nightstand where
condoms traditionally collect. But I would rather Plan B be used to
prevent pregnancy than the liberals' preferred method; a fork in the
head and a knife to the spinal cord.
