Push to Baghdad Begins; POW Safe in Army's Care

Hi, Judy. Thank you very much. As of an hour or so ago, we got word from
the battlefield that U.S. forces were just 15 miles away from the
southern edge of Baghdad. And they may be even closer right now. The
toughest fight, though, may lie ahead in the heart of the Iraqi capital.
Pentagon sources say the first phase of the final push into Baghdad is
now under way. U.S.-led forces were able to press farther north after
defeating Iraqi Republican Guard units at Karbala and Kut (ph). Our
embedded reporters say the two-pronged advance appears to be moving
faster than commanders expected. The Pentagon says two of the Republican
Guard divisions defending Baghdad are no longer credible forces. Scenes
from Najaf may also be bolstering the troops' spirit. Iraqis who
initially were cautious when U.S. forces arrived in Najaf ended cheering
them on, shaking their hands and patting their backs. U.S. Army's 7th
Cavalry is in the forefront of U.S. troops since they first left Kuwait
and crossed directly into the Iraqi desert. Our Walter Rodgers is
embedded with the unit's 3rd Squadron, which is leading the 3rd Infantry
Division's march toward the Iraqi capital.

Throughout the day, as the U.S. Army 7th Cavalry punched northward in the
general direction of Baghdad, we have seen huge convoys of supply troops
moving ever northward. Indeed, all the arrows on the Army's map seem to
be pointing in the direction of the southern suburbs of Baghdad. Earlier
in the day, the 1st Brigade of the 3rd Infantry Division took Karbala
with a minimum of fight. And then the 3rd Brigade of the 3rd Infantry
Division secured the town of Karbala. Additionally, the 7th Cavalry has
pushed onward in the general direction of Baghdad. Yesterday we were
about 50 miles from the southern suburbs of Baghdad. We have perhaps have
that distance. Throughout the day, we have watched the 3rd Infantry
Division bring in prisoners of war. Iraqi soldiers glad the war is over
for them, perhaps 100 at a time. There were times when the 7th Cavalry
itself got into some skirmishes as it pushed forward, again in the
direction of Baghdad. There was a bit of a firefight when the 7th Cavalry
came upon three Soviet vintage 20- millimeter anti-aircraft guns, ack-ack
guns. The Iraqi unit in possession of those guns fired mortars in the
direction of the 7th Cavalry. The Apache troop opened its tank guns,
opened its own mortars, decimated that unit, put it out of existence and
probably killed some 20 Iraqis in the process. This as it continues to
push ever closer towards the southern suburbs of Baghdad. Walter Rodgers,

And it's a similar story from CNN's Karl Penhaul who is now just miles
from the southern outskirts of the Iraqi capital. He's embedded with the
U.S. Army's 11th Attack Helicopter Regiment. Here's his report just filed
a few minutes ago.

The speed as they push to Baghdad seems to have gathered pace overnight
and in the course of this morning. In fact, it's going much faster than
many of the U.S. commanders on the ground predicted.

The intensity it's very quick moving, very fluid battle. The armor, and
mechanized infantry, and artillery pieces and personnel on the ground are
moving at rapid speeds.

<SPEAKER> PENHAUL </SPEAKER>
Overnight and early this morning, the tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles
of the 3rd Infantry Division backed by the Apache attack helicopters of
the 11th Aviation Regiment punched through the Republican Guard defenses
in and around Karbala. They were then able to advance far north of that
city and, as we speak, U.S. commanders tell me that elements of the 3rd
Infantry Division are now literally just a few miles from Baghdad.
