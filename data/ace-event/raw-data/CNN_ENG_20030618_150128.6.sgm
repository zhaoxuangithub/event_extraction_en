well, sex abuse by priests remains an issue in the catholic
church in the united states and it is certain to be an
issue as bishops gather tomorrow in st. louis for their
semiannual meeting. under a charter approved last year by
the national conference of catholic bishops, diocese
officials will report allegations of sexual abuse of a
minor to public authorities. past, present or future sexual
abuse of a minor will lead to removal from the ministry. no
priest or deacons who sexually abuse a minor may be
transferred to another desies. with me now to talk more
about the o'brien case and the divisions still dividing the
church are barbara blain, the founder of the survivors
network in st. louis and also joining us from detroit joe
mayor, the founder of a priest support group. barbara, to
you first. as the bishops get ready for this important
meeting tomorrow, are you satisfied that they have taken
all the appropriate steps to deal with the abuse issue?
