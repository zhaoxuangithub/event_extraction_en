3. Bush Cabinet President Bush has just been elected to another term
in office, and he has already started to appoint new people to his
political cabinet as current members like Colin Powell and John
Ashcroft resign.  Who would you like to see appointed to his cabinet
next term?  Who are they, and why do you think they should be
appointed? If you were president, which national figures would you
appoint to your cabinet and why?  What new cabinet positions would you
create and who would fill them?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Um -- and then I I don't -- know who would you who else would you -- well
what about Ruly -- Rudolph Giuliani
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
Well.  I don't know.  I you know what? I think -- I think Rudy Giuliani
was a great mayor -- for nine eleven.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Right.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
I don't think he was a great mayor the whole time he was a mayor.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Well, I I'm a New Yorker, and I got to tell you that I I think nine
eleven I I think -- basically made him.  Other than that, I think he was
a little too decisive.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Uh not I shouldn't say decisive, too divisive.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
Yeah, I think he
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
As far as -- the race relationship in this city. You know, it doesn't
take much to to please -- the other side. And that and that's what
government is all about.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
no, it doesn't.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
And he -- he wasn't -- he wasn't too much of a good uh
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
He he would've gone out as a mediocre mayor had it not.  And I but
even even saying that I can't begrudge him. But he did a great job in
the crisis. Some people do better in crises.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Yeah.  Exactly.  Exactly, exactly, I I think that nine eleven made him
and
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
and at that point in time, he wanted to stay on, which was sort of
sort of ridiculous.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
And if if if I don't think the rest of the country knows that, because
they don't know what he did before nine eleven, because they don't pay
any attention.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Eh -- Exactly.  Exactly, of course, you're right, you're quite right.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
And -- I think that if he did get a government agency,  it would have to
be one that was having crisis a lot of times I mean,  he would just
have to devote himself to that. If he could just do that, it would be
fine.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
It's a good point.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
But if he gets if gets into a lot of policy making and stuff that for
other things, you know,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I I I I know I one of the
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
I don't know.  Probably would be a good attorney general, he did that
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
it could very well, he did a good job, you're right, he probably could
follow in what's his name's footsteps.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
you know.  I think I think the cases that he picks and chooses
probably I wouldn't necessarily put on top of the list, but he did
seem to
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Right.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
prosecute everybody evenly.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Yeah. That much I think we can we can probably agree with. He will
probably do that evenly.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
Yes.  Right.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
I you know who I thought would have made a great, uh well I I know you
guys had your own political uh struggles in Jersey.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
Right.  Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Um and uh
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
It's a soap opera.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
oh it certainly was, I I saw the footage. I
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
Right, right, all of a sudden. I'll tell you this. Within one day,
everybody I met said -- oh, McGreevey, sure, I knew that.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Oh really?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
That became the national thing to say in Jersey, and in Jersey. Like,
everybody knew it, I'd be like, you did not. Nobody knew that.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
In Jersey?  Yeah I think I was -- I think I was -- I was on a cruise, and
I put on the television uh when I got in at the six oh clock news, and
bingo, there he is, uh resigning as Governor of uh New Jersey. I said,
you've got to be kidding me.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
But uh -- I thought he would have made a name for himself.  um -- I I
can't think of anyone anyone that anyone else out there that um -- that
warrants. I mean, you know, you just
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
No.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
pick people who I think will uh -- have the experience in government.
Well not in, not in government, but in the private sector. Um -- who are
responsible, and um -- put them in a position to lead.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
Well,  Yeah, I think uh -- apparently -- the President likes people that
are the same philo- -- political philosophy as him, and I'm not sure
I mean I think he just needs some other voices in there, but
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
That's right.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
I don't know if it'll happen. It's
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
That's a good point. Well, I
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
or not. He he needs some liberals in there and he needs some -- Ralph
Nader people, and some Green Party people, and some, just some.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Well I I think more conservative, what do you call them? Conservative
uh -- um -- um what do you call them? Uh conservative uh -- more -- oh bloody
he-
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
Ideologues?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
I yeah well I guess you could look at it that way, yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
eh
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Um.  Um.  I didn't particularly like the the tone about the the
religious uh -- side of -- the that election. I I thought that was a
little crazy.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
Yeah, I think pretty wack.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
If it's one thing we need to be careful about, it's separating the
Church from
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
Exactly, I'm a pastor, and that bothers me.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
and -- uh -- Yeah.  Oh I I'm glad to hear some uh an actual pastor who
says that. I I I think that we need to make sure that that that
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
that stays the way it is. I think it serves everyone well.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
Well, for one thing, it it ends up as the uh -- government officials are
those seeking office, and uh -- preaching and teaching to people, and
that's my job.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Right.  I agree.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
That's what I do. You mind your stuff, I'll tell my people what we're
doing.
