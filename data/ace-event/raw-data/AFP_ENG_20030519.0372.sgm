Shiites openly mark Mohammed's birthday in Iraq as lawlessness still

BAGHDAD, May 19 (AFP)

Shiite Muslims in Iraq Monday celebrated openly for the first time in
decades Prophet Mohammed's birthday, as continuing anarchy and chaos
threatened to undermine US efforts to rebuild the war-ravaged
country.

Meanwhile coalition officials in Iraq insisted plans for an Iraqi
government were still on track and Russia hinted that a compromise
could be imminent on a UN draft resolution to lift economic sanctions
on Iraq.

Thousands of Iraq's majority Shiite Muslims marched to their main
mosque in Baghdad to mark the birthday of Islam's founder Prophet
Mohammed.

Shiites, who celebrate the birthday a week later than Sunni Muslims,
were forbidden to publicly mark the date under the regime of Saddam
Hussein's Sunni-dominated regime.

The crowd filled the street leading to the Kazimiya mosque in the
northeast of Baghdad and carried banners in the green color of Islam,
calling for good government.

"No to injustice," "No to occupation," "No to Israel," "Yes to
Islam," chanted the demonstrators as speeches began from a platform.

Imam Mohammad al-Fartussi, who last week threatened violence against
"sinful" women, alcohol vendors and cinemas showing "indecent" films,
offered praise for the fall of Saddam and called Iraq "the land of
imams... land of Islam."

The demonstration came as Iraq's top US overseer Paul Bremer began
his second week on the job amid continuing lawlessness in the
country.

In his frenzied first seven days, the telegenic Bremer repeatedly
promised to restore the law and order that crumbled along with Saddam
Hussein's regime nearly six weeks ago.

But despite issuing a host of tough decrees, Bremer has failed to
stem the rampant crime and street violence plaguing the country.

Despite a security crackdown over the weekend in Baghdad and an
announcement that some 7,000 policemen had returned to their jobs
since the end of the war, ordinary Iraqis still felt unsafe on the
street with gunfire rife and police a near invisible presence.

In Baghdad, almost all the police stations have been destroyed or
looted since US troops took control of the capital on April 9. Only
two have so far reopened, and they have no equipment whatsoever.
Baghdad's top police job remains vacant.

And a trip to Baghdad's looter market only bears witness to the fact
that criminals are ruling the roost in the post-Saddam era.

Packed with the piles of stolen goods picked up during the frenzy of
theft that followed the collapse of Saddam's regime, the traders deal
in everything from computers and stereos to furniture and weapons.

Jalal Jamil, a 45-year-old jewellery store owner, said the situation
just keeps getting worse. "The Americans encourage people to steal
because when looting happens right under their noses they do
nothing," he said.

Bremer has also been criticized for backing away from an earlier US
timeline on forming a government in Iraq, but US-led coalition
officials Monday insisted government plans were still on track.

"We want to have an Iraqi voice in everything we do here but it would
be wrong to do that precipitously," said a source at the Organisation
of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA), which is
administering post-war Iraq.

Officials from Iraqi groups that met with Bremer last week have said
that he back peddled on what they said were earlier pledges to give
them a lead role in forming a new interim government in the next few
weeks.

"We understand that they want to have as much power as possible but
we told them: 'You won't be directly elected, you won't have any
direct experience of government," the source said.

"'Of course you will have input into the government but, since you
are not directly elected, it would be a nonsense for you to have
direct executive power,' the source said.

"The last thing we want is to leave a bunch of self-appointed
oligarchs in power," the source said.

The comments came on the same day that a prominent Iraqi called for
internationally-supervised elections in Iraq.

Adnan Pachachi, a onetime foreign minister who returned to Iraq on
May 6 after 33 years in exile, told the independent Az-Zaman daily
that elections should be held under international supervision.

An interim government should create an election code and laws to
clear the way for direct elections to a constituent assembly, that
would draw up a constitution, Pachachi said.

A referendum on the constitution would lead to elections for a new
government, the 80-year-old Pachachi told the daily.

On the diplomatic front, a top Russian official said Monday that the
UN Security Council would likely vote this week on a US-British draft
resolution to lift economic sanctions placed on Iraq in 1990 after
its invasion of Kuwait and to place its oil riches under coalition
control for at least a year.

"An updated text of the document may already be published today and
may be put to a vote this week," Deputy Foreign Minister Yury Fedotov
told ITAR-TASS news agency.

Yet Fedotov did not say whether Russia would back the resolution,
which diplomats have been revising since the United States, Britain
and Spain first submitted it more than a week ago.

Russia "will vote depending on what the resolution text turns out to
be," he said.

With billions of dollars in oil and debt interests in Iraq, Russia
has been anxious to secure UN involvement before supporting the
resolution.

Australia announced the creation Monday of an expert panel to help
Iraq protect its rich cultural heritage and assist Interpol in
recovering looted ancient artefacts.
