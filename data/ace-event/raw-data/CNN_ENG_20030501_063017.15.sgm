we were talking about the road map to middle east peace and
ran a footage about the chicken and these dogs. there is
the picture. the golden real estate treever on the left had
a litter of pups and the chicken got in the pen, a real
story, they're all hanging out. it looks as though the
puppies in one of the shots is trying to get lunch from the
chicken.
