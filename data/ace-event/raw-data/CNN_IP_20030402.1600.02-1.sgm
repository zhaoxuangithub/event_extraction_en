As coalition forces push ahead in their march toward Baghdad, they have
encountered some resistance in the Shiite holy city of Karbala. But
American troops and their superior technology have turned out to be a key
factor in the fighting there. And to the south, British forces continue
their attack on targets around Basra. ITN correspondent Tim Ewart
reports.

<SPEAKER> TIM EWART, ITN CORRESPONDENT </SPEAKER>
These are soldiers of the U.S. 3rd Infantry, fighting near Karbala,
southwest of Baghdad. They are facing Saddam Hussein's Republican Guard,
his finest soldiers. But for all the resistance, coalition aircraft rule
the skies and coalition technology is overwhelmingly superior. U.S.
commanders believe the Republican Guard is a doomed force.

<SPEAKER> BRIG. GEN. VINCENT BROOKS, U.S. CENTRAL COMMAND </SPEAKER>
We will approach Baghdad. The dagger is clearly pointed at the heart of
the regime right now and will remain pointed at it until the regime is
gone.

<SPEAKER> EWART </SPEAKER>
To the south, more black smoke over the town of Basra. British troops
control the outskirts of the town, and today destroyed another building
they said housed Iraqi fighters. There is much fear here of the Saddam
loyalists who still hold sway in Basra and of the invading troops waiting
at the gates. (on camera): The Americans are racing towards Baghdad, the
British still seem anxious to make their progress here as measured as
possible. Basra will fall. But there may first be fighting in the
capital, 250 miles to the north. Tim Ewart, ITV News, southern Iraq.

From the south to the north in the rolling hills of northern Iraq,
coalition air strikes targeted Iraqi positions today in what's been
called a ferocious bombardment. It happened outside the oil-rich city of
Kirkuk. CNN's Brent Sadler is there.

<SPEAKER> BRENT SADLER, CNN CORRESPONDENT </SPEAKER>
A back road leading to Kirkuk, the heartland of northern Iraq's oil
wealth. A road that's now in the hands of Iraqi Kurdish forces. Occupying
these positions, strattled along a crescent-shaped front line east of
Kirkuk. This land fell into Iraqi-Kurdish hands without a shot being
fired. Iraqi soldiers fled these positions in a hurry, under the
onslaught of coalition bombing. This is the end of the road for Kurdish
forces manning this remote checkpoint. But with special permission, they
let us through. We are now between the lines, a no man's land of
abandoned Iraqi bunkers and an unnerving silence, broken by the roar of
warplanes and the distant surge of air strikes. This territory is within
easy artillery range of Saddam Hussein's forces and circling Kirkuk. The
oil capital of northern Iraq is visible behind me, just over there, a
harmless flare of burning gases is easily identifiable. Iraq's precious
oil field remain intact. Also intact, Kirkuk's defenses, in the distant
haze. Iraq's armed opposition, including these Kurds, waits on the
sidelines to join the fray, if America asks.

<SPEAKER> PRIME MINISTER BARHAM SALEH, KURDISTAN REGIONAL GOV. </SPEAKER>
This is about freedom for Iraq. This is about the liberation of Iraq, and
we Iraqis must shoulder the responsibility of helping in the process of
liberation.

<SPEAKER> SADLER </SPEAKER>
And, says the Iraqi opposition, in winning this war. Brent Sadler, CNN,
near Kirkuk in northern Iraq.
