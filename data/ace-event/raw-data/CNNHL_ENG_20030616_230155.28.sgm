how could so many people end up in prison for crimes they
didn't commit? the story behind the defendants of tulia,
texas, is our "headlines timeline." july 23rd, 1999 --
there was a massive drug bust in a predominately
african-american neighborhood in tulia. of the 46 people
arrested, 39 are african-american. the case against them
was based on the testimony of undercover officer thomas
coleman. coleman claimed he bought drugs from the
defendants, but offered little or no supporting evidence.
after the first of several trials ended with convictions
and harsh sentences, most of the other defendants pleaded
guilty to avoid hard time. march 17, 2003 -- with coleman's
credibility under serious attack, new hearings for the
tulia defendants get under way. the hearings are stopped
when the judge, defense attorneys and prosecutors agree
that coleman lied under oath and is a racist. coleman
denies doing anything wrong. it took a special act of the
texas legislature to clear the way for monday's release.
but these men and the others caught up in the tulia tragedy
are still convicted criminals. now it's up to the appeals
court and the board of pardon and paroles to officially
clear their names.
