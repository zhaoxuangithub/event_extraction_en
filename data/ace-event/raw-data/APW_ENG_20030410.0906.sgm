Iraq's U.N. ambassador meets Annan, won't discuss future plans

Iraq's U.N. Ambassador Mohammed Al-Douri, the first Iraqi official to
concede defeat in the U.S.-led war, met privately with
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, but refused to talk about rumors that
he was planning to leave New York.

``I am sorry,'' he said. ``No Answer.''

``No comment at all. This is my last word to you,'' he told hordes of
journalists who chased him Thursday at his New York residence and
U.N. headquarters seeking comment on his talks with the
secretary-general, his future and the war.

Asked who should govern Iraq, Al-Douri said: ``I have nothing to do
with that.''

Annan also declined to comment on Thursday's meeting with Al-Douri.

With the fall of Baghdad Wednesday, Al-Douri declared ``the game is
over'' and expressed hope that the Iraqi people will now be able to
live in peace. He said he had not been in touch with Baghdad.

Beside meeting with Annan, Al-Douri spent several hours during the
late morning and afternoon meeting with ambassadors and diplomats in
the Delegate's Lounge.

``I wished him good luck but I don't know what he said to the
secretary-general and what will be his next steps,'' said Arab League
Secretary-General Amr Moussa, who talked with Al-Douri before his own
meeting with Annan.

In an interview with The Associated Press Wednesday night, Al-Douri
said he will continue to work at the United Nations and had no
intention of defecting.

``Defecting from who?'' he asked. ``I think the government has
already defected. There is no more Iraqi government to be defected
from.''

Annan said early Thursday  _  before meeting Al-Douri  _  that in
talks with the envoy Monday, ``he didn't ask for an asylum or
protection ... (and) he didn't ask me for help with his status.''

``We did talk about what happens, depending on the evolution of
things on the ground,'' Annan said.

The ambassador had vehemently defended his country for months as the
United States and its allies sought U.N. backing for war on Iraq.
Privately, many U.N. diplomats see him as a respectable colleague.

``I sympathize with his need to create a new life for himself,'' said
Britain's U.N. Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock.

Al-Douri taught international law at Baghdad University for over 30
years before becoming a diplomat in 1999, first at the United Nations
in Geneva and since early 2001 at U.N. headquarters in New York.

He said in the AP interview he would love to return to teaching but
for now he plans to remain at the United Nations. ``Things will be
crystalized one day,'' he said.

``What I worried about is that things are settled in the country ...
so in the future the Iraqi people will live in peace without
sanctions, without wars, without suffering. This is my message.''

Separately, lawyers who claim that Iraq helped plan the 1995 Oklahoma
City bombing that killed 168 people asked a judge at a federal court
in New York to force Al-Douri to testify in the case and hold the
envoy in contempt, saying they worry that he would flee the country.

But U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said Al-Douri still has diplomatic
immunity as Iraq's ambassador. Under U.N. rules, a new Iraqi
government would have to ask to represent the country, which the
General Assembly would then consider.

``He is still Iraq's ambassador at the United Nations,'' White House
spokesman Ari Fleischer said in Washington. ``Legally, that is the
way it works at the U.N.''

Larry Klayman, chairman of Judicial Watch, which represent 14
survivors and victims' relatives who have filed a $1.5 billion
federal lawsuit against Iraq in Washington, said his organization had
served a subpoena on Al-Douri twice, on March 26 and March 28, but
said he has not responded.

U.S. District Judge John S. Martin did not immediately rule but
scheduled a hearing for next week.

The April 19, 1995, bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah federal building
was the deadliest terrorist strike on American soil at the time. The
suit claims Iraqi officials provided money and training to convicted
bomber Timothy McVeigh and conspirator Terry Nichols. McVeigh was
executed in 2001, and Nichols is serving a life sentence.
