Troubled French media group Vivendi set to sell theme parks: report

LOS ANGELES, May 2 (AFP)

Beleaguered French media group Vivendi Universal is in advanced
negotiations to sell its theme park business to a US firm for around
1.5 billion dollars, the Los Angeles Times said Friday.

The report came as the indebted group said it was planning to sell
off its US unit Vivendi Universal Entertainment and other assets, to
focus on its telecoms activities and its French cable television
business.

The Times said Vivendi Universal was negotiating to sell its flagship
theme parks to New York investment firm Blackstone Group as a the
first step toward dismantling its entertainment empire.

Vivendi Universal officials in the United States were not immediately
available for comment on Friday.

Under the reported plans, Blackstone Group would buy Vivendi's theme
park division, including Universal Studios Hollywood, Universal
Orlando in Florida and Universal's ownership interests in parks in
Spain and Japan, a source close to the negotiations told the paper.

Blackstone already holds a 50 percent stake in the two parks that
make up Universal Orlando.

Vivendi earlier this week confirmed months of press speculation that
it planned to shed its entertainment assets by the end of the year,
including its famed Universal movie studio and television assets.

Chief executive Jean-Rene Fourtou told shareholders at the group's
annual general meeting Tuesday that the sale of Vivendi Universal
Entertainment was a major goal for 2003, and that negotiations were
already under way.

However, Fourtou said he had not yet received any firm offer for its
giant US music business, Universal Music Group, and had taken no
final decision over its future.

The group, once a French utilities company, needs to reshape itself
in order to slash its huge debt burden of around 18 billion dollars.

In 2002, the group recorded a net loss of 23.3 billion euros -- the
biggest ever in France -- on sales of 28.7 billion.
