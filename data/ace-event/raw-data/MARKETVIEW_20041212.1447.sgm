Conglomerates are a fascinating species: The standard definition is
'a company involved in multiple unrelated businesses' but the more
accurate definition would be 'a company that relies on financial
pyrotechnics, balance sheet juggling, and adroit accounting to create
the illusion of growth'. I love to write about them, but I'd hate to own
one, since most of their market value comes from the market's assumption
that the company's leaders will somehow find a way to retroactively
justify their overvaluation. Usually, it doesn't work, but when it does
the results can be spectacularly entertaining. For a while (see
Ling-Temco-Vought or Tyco for details).

The recent rumors about WalMart's plans to buy out a shipping company
have given rise to the fear that the company may go the conglomerate
route. They have many of the symptoms of a late-stage conglomerate: A
gigantic main business with slowing growth, fear that competition will
substantially reduce the profitability of their main business, a
shareholder base that includes many people who own only WalMart stock
(thus providing another incentive for intracompany diversification), and
enough resources to pull it off on a grand scale.

I can understand the concerns, but I don't see the motivation. As a
retailer of just about everything, WalMart can expand into some pretty
broadly-defined areas without going beyond either their core
competencies or some arenas where they can cut costs. After all, adding
some international shipping assets to their holdings would be a natural
extension of their enormously successful practice of buying the
distribution network for their products. They're coming close to
Smithfield Food's very successful 'squeal to meal' policy; if these
rumors are true, the result for shareholders will be a pretty positive
one.
