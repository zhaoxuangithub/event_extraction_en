<SUBJECT> OT Best organization for donation </SUBJECT>

I would like to make a donation to help the survivors of the tsunami. I
have a lot of skepticism with the Red Cross and a few others based on
horror stories I have heard reported in the media. Because of this I
have always shied away from these national organizations and stuck with
local groups. Any thoughts as to where my money would go the furthest.
Appreciate any input.

I've heard mostly positive things about how the Red Cross is handling their
donations, with a very high percentage of the donated funds going directly
for relief and not for administrative expenses. So that is the channel we
chose for our own donation.

For what it's worth to you, here's some contact information for a few
agencies that seem to be highly regarded. The Habitat for Humanity might be
a good one to consider, since their expertise is in building housing, which
of course is so beadly needed over there at this time:

American Red Cross: Disaster Relief Fund, P.O. Box 37243, Washington, DC
20013. Phone: (800) 435-7669

Habitat for Humanity International: Asia Tsunami Response Fund, 121 Habitat
St., Americus, GA 31709-3498. Phone: (800) 422-4828

Save the Children: Attn: Asian Earthquake/Tsunami Relief Fund, 54 Wilton
Road, Westport, CT 06880. Phone: (800) 728-3843

The Salvation Army: P.O. Box 269, Alexandria, VA 22313. (800) 725-2763.

Actually more of the money from your donation has a chance of going
directly toward its intended purpose than any other charity. The Red
Cross normally deducts 9% from all deductions for its administratice
costs. It has announced that it will forego the 9% on donations
earmarked for tsunami relief and that 100% of these funds will go
directly toward aid.

9% in administrative costs would place the Red Cross among charity
organizations making the the most efficient use of donated funds. The
figure for most charities is 10-16%.

I don't know what negative stories about the Red Cross you have heard.
But nothing is 100% and no organization of any kind is perfect. Just
because of its size, which dwarfs most other charities, I would assume
that the Red Cross may be responsible for proportionately more
blunders than most other charitable organizations.
------------------------------ ------------

As tragic as the earthquake and tsunami in South Asia have been, it is
truly uplifting to see how so many people have opened their hearts and
so generously responded to the call for help toward disaster relief
efforts. Money from private donations has been flowing into charitable
relief organizations at an unprecedented rate, in some cases by
millions of dollars per hour. "Tsunami aid" was the fourth most
frequently used term used in internet searches last week. Although the
need for help is still continuing, some individual charities have
announced that they have already received as much in donations as they
can put to use for this effort.

The following announcement was received from MSF

"Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has received
an extraordinary outpouring of support for the people of South Asia
and we are extremely grateful. As you know, it is very important to
MSF that we use your contribution as you intend it to be used. This is
why we want to let you know that at this time, MSF estimates that we
have received sufficient funds for our currently foreseen emergency
response in South Asia."

I've read that too - unfortunate, because I've worked with them in
Rwanda and was very impressed with the professionalism of their
organization. They also stated that there are lots of places in the
world where they continue to work which needs plenty of help too -
quite an important reminder because other needy areas of the world are
getting less donations now. So they didn't discourage donations to
them per se, just not for this specific area. Of course I realize that
most people will want to help where the need for it is the most
immediate.

All in all, the statement has confirmed my view that Doctors without
Borders ia a very professional operatoin.

No org is perfect. Our news system thrives on finding a chinc in the armor
of an organisation, a not perfect organisation. They need ratings and will
do anything for it. IMHO, go with the Red Cross, or any other national
organisation. Just give carefully. if you are going to give assistance then
LOOK with suspicion at all they do it is better to keep your $$$. All you
have done is to buy a difficult time.
