<SUBJECT> The old wedding problem </SUBJECT>

Two of my nephews were excluded from their brother's wedding this weekend
because they are not LDS. Of interest, neither went to the reception
either. Both were extremely hurt, particularly since they know their
brother could have had a civil ceremony and then been married in the temple
later. I was offended because one of those nephews and I are very close,
and he was really upset.

The groom said "it wasn't quite what I had expected." The bride is not
quite able to speak in front of strangers, so I don't know what she thought.
She did tell my niece that she thought her husband was a good catch--RM
attending BYU and all that.

I got a sort of an icky feeling when I realized the only people who did
attend the kid's wedding was his unmedicated bi-polar mother and his father,
who suffers from Alzheimers.

That's sad, Lee. I really think it's time for the church to admit that a
civil ceremony followed by a temple sealing reaches the same goal, often in
a more loving way, than insisting that only the sealing is worth doing. A
change of that sort would be very simple to implement, and most church
members would like it better than allowing non-LDS family members into the
temple, which would actually be my preference.

There's been a thread recently in one of the exMo fora about a woman whose
bishop, who she had been planning to have marry her, was going out of town,
so she asked the stake president, who she didn't know well. He insisted that
he needed to make the point, as part of performing the ceremony, that she
really needed to be married in the temple, even though her fiance was not
LDS. She ultimately declined his services.

How to get the message across to young people that considering the feelings
of their family is just as important as being sealed for time and all
eternity? I don't know. It would have to be some sort of grassroots
movement, I think, since it's not likely to come through official,
correlated channels.

*shrugs* I chose to have a civil ceremony largely because my wife and I
were both converts and a temple ceremony would have excluded both families
completely. From a family standpoint it sounded liek a good decision,
harmony and all that...plus the temple ceremony could be sealed a year
later. Unfortunately we started off on the wrong foot for a lot of reasons
and the marriage didn't last. I can't help but wonder if perhaps we did
ourselves a diservice by not getting sealedi ntially, and making our
marriage a gospel focused one. Who's to say. It's a tough decision to make
and despite the feeling I myself caved I feel people should be understanding
of the rationale. For my part if we had been sealed intially there simply
wouldn't have been ANYONE there and both our families had harsh feeligns
about the church as is, and a sealign would have only created more
disharmony. For my part though, I think we started the marriage with a
compromise and deined ourselves tremendous blessing and ultimately paid the
price.

Hmm... I wonder how many success stories are out there from people who chose
to have a civil ceremony, and went on later to be happily sealed. I know
that was what happened with my own parents, largely because their decision
to get married and my father's decision to join the church came very close
together, and they didn't want to wait the year until he would be able to
enter the temple. They're still together after more than 55 years.
