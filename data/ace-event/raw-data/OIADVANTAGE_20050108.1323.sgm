It is just about time for Fortune magazine to release its 2005 list
of 100 Best Companies to Work For . So now is a good time to ask a
simple question: Why should we care? Making this list is certainly a
source of pride. It can also be helpful if you are looking for a nice
new job. Should anyone else pay attention to this list?

Well, thanks for asking because I just happen to have an answer for
that question. It turns out that investors can benefit by paying
attention to this list as well. In a study published in the Journal of
Business Finance &amp; Accounting (2003, 30:771-798), Greg Filbeck and
Dianna Preece found that companies on the Fortune list of 100 Best
Companies to Work For outperformed a matched sample of firms along
multiple measures of return. This study is particularly relevant for
investors because the authors measured return after the list was
announced. To often these studies use as a starting point the moment
before information becomes public. The only way to benefit from such
information is by holding the stock before the information becomes
public. This study indicates that the Best Companies to Work For
information may still be useful even after the information becomes
public.

It might also be useful to look at companies that have consistently
made the list in the previous few years and make an educated guess about
their inclusion on this year's list. Search the news archives and see if
in the past year the company did anything that might have totally pissed
off their employees. Massive layoffs, bitter union battles, stopped
offering free massages, etc. You might also want to be wary if the CEO
or a bunch of other top executives have been replaced. That can often
generate a period of uncertainty in a workforce.
