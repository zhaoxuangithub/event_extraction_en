11. Holiday Traditions: The holiday season is right around the
corner. Who do you like to celebrate with during the holidays? Do you go
to a lot of parties with friends, neighbors, co-workers or family
members? Are there people you see during the holidays that you don't see
during the rest of the year? Do you travel to meet up with family or
friends during the holidays? Where do you go and who do you visit?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
Hi this is Ed.  good. how are you doing Jane?  if you hear noise in
the background, I'm enjoying the holiday season walking in New York
City, so
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Jane </SPEAKER>
Oh, okay.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
((city)) -- ((trusts of life)) -- crazy people and, uh, other things going
on but that's New York, what can you say.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Jane </SPEAKER>
Yeah yeah yeah.  Used to live in New York. My brother-in-law still
lives in the city but we were Long Island people.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
Yeah.  Uh,  so what are you doing for the festive holidays.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Jane </SPEAKER>
You know, it's really bad because I still really don't know. I'm up in
the air with about six different clients trying to decide what we're
going to do.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
((Allan)) -- Well, that's not bad. That means that you've got a lot of
people to see and do things with. That's good.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Jane </SPEAKER>
Yeah, makes it kind of hectic. How about you? What are you doing?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
Ah, family.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Jane </SPEAKER>
Ach.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
Yeah. Yeah, we're going to be doing, uh,  the typical.  Go up and
celebrate with the family and -- be with the little kids.  You know, the
((tough years)) and that which makes it -- because when you get older
it's kind of,  I've got all the gifts, I don't need that. What I
really want to do is see somebody else enjoy it and the little kids
enjoy it.  So- -- and, uh, do a lot of parties with family -- and friends.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Jane </SPEAKER>
Well, that's kind of where- we're in between which family we're going
to see and when and how and get all that worked out.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
Uh,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Jane </SPEAKER>
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
so whoev- yeah, I've seen them- -- just not the gifts it comes down to
the food. See, now you (()).
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Jane </SPEAKER>
There you go.  I- one of these choices is meat cooking. We'll have to
put that towards the end.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
((Ah, oui.)) -- Eh, ((nice)).  So we- we've only-
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Jane </SPEAKER>
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
my family's, uh,  parents are deceased and most of ((them)) is, uh,
passed my brothers all over, so her family's still younger -- and, uh,
you know, just the odd sides. She's the oldest and I'm the youngest,
so she's got younger which -- keeps the thing going, so I- -- you know, my
view is -- ((stay)) with the family go visit the family. That's all you
got.  So -- keep it together through thick and thin and -- when it comes
to Thanksgiving we go up there and we celebrate.  And then there's
little parties.  Big- uh, her sister does a big family party -- but try
to keep that same
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Jane </SPEAKER>
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
local family coming together.  It's amazing how they can get into
little squabbles and who doesn't show up
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Jane </SPEAKER>
Of course.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
like that. I think it's crazy.  So, ((so, uh))-
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Jane </SPEAKER>
They used to always really all get together. but his parents uh they
actually live next door to us. but they're starting to get up in the
years, so they're not,  you know, hosting the big parties, so it's
funny how now people don't all bother to come
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Jane </SPEAKER>
and you kind of wonder you know in the next couple of years what's all
going to happen. Are they all going to see each other.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
Yeah, no that's- that's exactly. I've already seen,  you know, ((in))
my parents ((' bed)) until they ((got)) less and less that the
brothers got together -- and then now when there's an event you try to
do it.  At Christmas it's just impossible because we leave -- two days
after Christmas
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Jane </SPEAKER>
Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
to go out of the country as part of our New Year's
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Jane </SPEAKER>
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
celebration. So, for us it's, you know, got to be a quick trip up
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Jane </SPEAKER>
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
to her family and then back where we- -- we've been invited to be down
in
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Jane </SPEAKER>
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
another country. If a person is not- even though it's cold up in the
Northeast, it's a family tradition. I should do it -- and less for the
gifts and more for
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Jane </SPEAKER>
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
being together.  Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Jane </SPEAKER>
Well, we did- -- -for the kids you know we made it pretty cl-
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
I don't know, I think that's great.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Jane </SPEAKER>
-you know, you didn't have all the hassle of running around and being
crazy and just kind of spent time together
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
And I think that's very- I mean, if-
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Jane </SPEAKER>
and it was really pretty nice.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
Yeah, we haven't- -- yeah, I think -- e- e- eventually that may happen,
the way we're going with, uh,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Jane </SPEAKER>
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
my wife and I with her
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Jane </SPEAKER>
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
family. Not as a negative but as a-
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Jane </SPEAKER>
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
you know, we do a lot of traveling so that's going to be- I think
that's going to come up.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Jane </SPEAKER>
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
But- -- but for now we're still trying to do-
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Jane </SPEAKER>
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
as long as the mother's around,  we'll still do Christmas and act as-
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Jane </SPEAKER>
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
she is not really old, but she's getting older, so I think that's one
reason to stay together
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Jane </SPEAKER>
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
and also I think i- is
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Jane </SPEAKER>
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
eh, we- we kind of -- infused a little family party that her sister has
so -- I think if we were to go away both of those might fall off a
little bit and it doesn't take but one year and then all of the sudden
everybody's
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Jane </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
not coming to it anymore and it's like a-
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Jane </SPEAKER>
That's it. That's the way it is.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
Yeah, but not because-
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Jane </SPEAKER>
If I'm no-
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
it is- -- I- I enjoy the -- smiling people and the festive- -- festive
nature and -- I think it does get a little commercialized. ((It's not
that the-)) -- You can ignore that part of it, I guess.
