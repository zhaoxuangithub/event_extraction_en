Former Senator Chuck Robb hasn't been heard from lately. Parade
magazine reminds us today that he's a co-chair of the Commission on the
Intelligence Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass
Destruction. They will report on March 31. I suspect Rob will speak out
after that date, although much of the Committee's report will be
classified.

Virginia is blessed to have so many respected foreign policy and
security policy public servants, past and present.

Good old Chuck Robb...I assume everyone on here has seen "The Perfect
Candidate"? Quite a treat.
