The premier of the western Canadian province of British Columbia
pleaded no contest to driving drunk during a Hawaiian vacation in
January.

Gordon Campbell was ordered to pay fines and fees totaling $913,
complete a 14-hour alcohol assessment program and have a substance
abuse assessment. Under a no contest plea, the defendant neither
admits nor denies the charge but agrees not to contest it.

``Mr. Campbell is sufficiently embarrassed and ashamed for what he
did, as well he should be,'' District Judge Reinette Cooper said
Monday.

Campbell was not in court. Lawyer Steven Barta said his client had
already completed the required programs in Canada. He also brought a
check from Campbell to pay the fines and fees.

In the provincial capital of Victoria, Campbell said he was treated
fairly and no longer drinks alcohol.

Campbell, 55, was pulled over Jan. 10 after police observed him
driving erratically in a rented sport-utility vehicle. Campbell's
blood-alcohol reading was 0.161 percent, more than twice the legal
limit, in a roadside sobriety test.

In a tearful news conference after returning to Vancouver two days
later, Campbell apologized to British Columbians, but refused to
resign as premier. He said he drank three martinis and some wine
before getting behind the wheel.
