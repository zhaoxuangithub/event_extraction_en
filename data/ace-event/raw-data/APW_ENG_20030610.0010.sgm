Seven people convicted last week in Vietnam's biggest-ever criminal
trial, including two former senior government officials, have
requested an appeal of the verdicts, a court official said Tuesday.

The seven include former state radio director Tran Mai Hanh and
former vice national chief prosecutor Pham Sy Chien, both convicted
of receiving bribes, the court official said on condition of
anonymity.

The trial by a Ho Chi Minh City court was seen as a litmus test of
the communist government's resolve to fight widespread corruption.

The ``godfather'' of organized crime, Truong Van Cam  _  better known
as Nam Cam  _  was convicted of seven crimes, including murder. He
was sentenced to face a firing squad, and his lawyer has said he also
plans to appeal.

Hanh, also a former member of the powerful Communist Party Central
Committee, was convicted of receiving US$8,500 in bribes from Nam
Cam's family to secure the crime boss' early release from labor camp
in 1990s. Hanh was sentenced to 10 years in jail.

Chien was convicted of receiving a stereo set worth 27 million dong
(US$1,750) from Nam Cam's family and sentenced to six years in jail.

Five other people who were sentenced up to five years in jail for
crimes such as gambling and receiving bribes have also filed appeals,
the official said.

A total of 155 defendants stood trial during the three months of
proceedings. All but five were convicted. One defendant was
acquitted, while the court sent four other cases back to police for
further investigation.

Under Vietnamese law, the convicted have 15 days to appeal their
sentences.
