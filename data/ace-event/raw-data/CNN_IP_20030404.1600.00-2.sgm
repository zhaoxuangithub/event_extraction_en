Attacking on the ground and calling in air strikes, Kurdish fighters and
U.S. troops have dislodged stubborn Iraqi soldiers at a key bridge in
northern Iraq. Iraqis pulled back on the road to Mosul as CNN's Jane
Arraf reports from the battlefield.

A few miles further to Mosul, Kurdish militia and their flags speeding to
a town abandoned by Iraqi forces. After a day of fighting, the Iraqis
were driven back five kilometers, about three miles down the main road
west towards Mosul from the Kurdish city of Erbil. Soldiers were Kurdish,
but the special forces calling in air strikes on Iraqi positions were
American. As U.S. warplanes dropped bombs near the town, Kurdish fighters
moved forward. (on camera): There's a slow-and-steady battle going on
here for control of the key bridge. It's a bridge over the river on the
main road to Mosul. The Iraqis are firing artillery like that in response
to the Americans are calling in air strikes. The Peshmerga are just down
the road, and the Iraqis have retreated, but they're still holding on to
the bridge. (voice-over): That blast turned out to be a rocket-propelled
grenade, but there's plenty of artillery and mortar fire to come.

Less than 20 minutes later, with Iraqi defenses pounded by the bombing,
they no longer held the bridge over the Khoser River. In this vehicle,
the only Iraqi casualties we saw. Their military radio and guns
indicating they were combatants. (on camera): It's still smoldering, this
truck with three Iraqi soldiers. It was either shelled or bombed. Now,
it's a small part of this battle for the bridge just behind us. These
were lying on the ground next to the truck. Somebody picked them up. It's
an I.D. card, presumably for one of the soldiers. The only thing you can
really tell from it is that he was 27 years old. And a snapshot from when
his life was still ahead of him. Other evidence of a hurried retreat amid
the smoldering vehicles, a discarded gas mask. Military documents.
Notebooks with verses from the Koran. Kurdish fighters planted their flag
and left it waving in the smoke of the bombed-out Iraqi truck. The
village of Manguba (ph), just 32 kilometers, about 23 miles from Mosul is
now in Kurdish hands. One Kurdish soldier did the honors of tearing up a
poster of Saddam Hussein. Not just the poster, but the frame and
cardboard backing as well. They've been waiting a long time. Jane Arraf,
CNN, on the bridge over the Khoser River in northern Iraq.

<SPEAKER> BLITZER </SPEAKER>
Thanks very much. Judy, dangerous assignment for all of our reporters,
our embedded journalists. And one of them, not from our CNN, but from a
very close friend of all of ours, Michael Kelly, paid that price. The
first American embedded journalist to have gotten killed in covering this
war. We'll have more on him at 5:00 on our special edition of "WOLF
BLITZER REPORTS." Until then, thanks, Judy, back to you.

<SPEAKER> WOODRUFF </SPEAKER>
Thanks, Wolf. And we'll be watching. Michael Kelly, of course, with
"Atlantic Monthly," and a columnist for the "Washington Post." Well, at
least three U.S. service members were killed today in an apparent suicide
bomb attack at a checkpoint near the Haditah Dam northwest of Baghdad.
Those deaths are not yet included in the official casualty count. At last
report, though, 41 Americans had been killed by hostile forces, 13 others
by friendly fire or in accidents. Of the 27 British troops, in all who
have been killed, at least 19 of them were said to be victims of friendly
fire or accidents. The official Iraqi casualty figures remain the same
this day, including more than 400 civilians killed, Iraqi authorities
say. And U.S. Central Command says more than 4,000 Iraqis have been
captured, but British officials believe that figure is much higher. We
know that seven Americans are known to be held as prisoner of war in
Iraq. Another 15 Americans listed as missing in action. Well, funeral
services were held today in Colorado for 21-year- old Marine Corporal
Randall Kent Rosacker. He was killed in action in Iraq. His story is
especially poignant. His father is a navy commander. He received word of
his son's death within hours after the submarine that he was assigned to
returned home from an extended deployment. The Iraqis promise an
unconventional attack on U.S. troops tonight. Do they mean guerilla
warfare, as in Vietnam? We're going to ask our military analyst. That's
coming up.
