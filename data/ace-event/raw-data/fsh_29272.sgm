4. Peterson Trial Scott Peterson has been found guilty of murdering
his wife Laci and their unborn son, and he now faces the death
penalty.  Do you think he is guilty of the crimes he's been convicted
of?  If so, what were his motives?  How closely did you follow the
trial and what do you think of all of the media coverage of the trial?
What kind of sentencing should Peterson receive?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Alithia </SPEAKER>
Hi.  I'm Alithia.  Um,  uh, Scott Peterson trial.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
((Did you-))
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Alithia </SPEAKER>
Ah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
The only reason I- I, uh, actually picked to do this one is I lived in
Redwood City, so.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Alithia </SPEAKER>
Redwood, where's that?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Um, it's northern California.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Alithia </SPEAKER>
Oh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Where the trial's at.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Alithia </SPEAKER>
And the trial's there.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Yes.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Alithia </SPEAKER>
Oh, you pick your own -- you pick your own topic?  Mm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
No, I just picked it. They just called me and I'm like -- I heard
Scott Peterson and I'm like, yeah, I know what the question's going to
be about.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Alithia </SPEAKER>
Yeah, I heard something about it. I don't know. I- I don't know if
he's- if he's guilty or not. What do you think?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
I think so. I think he got into an argument with her and he pushed
her. And I think she fell and maybe she hit her head or something and
it killed her, so he panicked.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Alithia </SPEAKER>
What about the baby?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
I don't think he -- you know, I thi- I don't know.  I don- eh, you
know, because -- th- well, with the baby and stuff, you know, she was
still pregnant at that time, so.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Alithia </SPEAKER>
Oh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
You never know.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Alithia </SPEAKER>
Yeah, because I was really -- I wasn't really following it that much
because I was-
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Alithia </SPEAKER>
but -- ((but I'd love to have his hair)) something just came off the ~TV
about the Scott trial.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Yeah. Where are you at?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Alithia </SPEAKER>
I'm in South Carolina.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Oh, okay. Yeah. I live in Redwood City, which they actually moved the
trial here a couple months into it.  Um, from Modesto, California.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Alithia </SPEAKER>
Oh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Where he had committed the murders, so.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Alithia </SPEAKER>
Okay.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Yeah, we're a pretty small town, so our newspaper covers it a lot.
Still do, I'm kind of sick of hearing about him, but -- e- hopefully
this'll be the end of it.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Alithia </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Once they sentence him ((I bet)).
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Alithia </SPEAKER>
Yeah.  Hopefully, you know, if he's guilty hopefully, you know, they
find him guilty -- and hopefully they have evidence, you know. Do you
know if they have, like, evidence and,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Alithia </SPEAKER>
you know, against him or whatever?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
There was so much evidence, you know, it's -- a lot of it couldn't be
used, a lot of it was used in that,  you know, what they used against
him.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Alithia </SPEAKER>
How would -- did they, like, found, like, eh, you know, fingerprints
or whatever?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Um, no. Um, they brought the boat down, or a duplicate of the boat
to, kind of, you know, get a feel for it but they had to remove it
from Redwood City because people were putting flowers in it in -- memory
of Laci and, you know, planting flowers around it and stuff, so it was
pretty interesting.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Alithia </SPEAKER>
Oh, yeah, that's cool.  Eh, did you all -- did you all know her, or?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
But I- -- What?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Alithia </SPEAKER>
Did you all know Laci, or?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Um,  a friend of mine's sister used to work in a maternity wear store
and Laci Peterson, the day before she disappeared, was in her store
maternity shopping.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Alithia </SPEAKER>
Oh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
So, yeah, it was my friend's sister -- who lives in Modesto.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Alithia </SPEAKER>
Oh, okay.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Yeah, so, it kind of hit close to home with her, she's just -- you
know, because she kind of felt like she knew her and
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Alithia </SPEAKER>
Right.  Yeah, I think it's very sad,  you know, just hearing about it.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Yeah, it's -- it's -- a whole long process. They've been at this for
almost three years, so.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Alithia </SPEAKER>
Three years?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Yeah, it's almost been three years.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Alithia </SPEAKER>
Oh, I thought it was just getting on ~TV over here.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
No.  Yeah, it might be over there, but it's been on here for a long
time.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Alithia </SPEAKER>
So, it must've just went local and then then went national
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Alithia </SPEAKER>
Oh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
You know, we're close to the trial so of course it's going to be in
the newspaper every single day.  So, it's, you know, and the trial,
the, um,  what is it called, the verdict, was actually read by audio
over the ~TV. So it it's pretty ((depressing))
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Alithia </SPEAKER>
Mhm.  Is this the case that's trying to, um,  uh, they're trying to-
to get a new juror?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Mm,
