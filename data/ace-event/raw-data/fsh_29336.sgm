5. Death of Arafat (1) Controversial PLO leader Yasser Arafat died in
a Paris hospital last week.  Do you think Arafat's death will help or
hurt the Israeli-Palestinian peace process?  Was Arafat a good leader?
What do you think US policy should be toward Palestine now that Arafat
has died? What, if anything, should the US do to be involved in the
Middle East peace process?

<SPEAKER> Gandhi </SPEAKER>
Hi, good evening.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Hi. Wha- I didn't catch your name. What's your name?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Gandhi </SPEAKER>
Gandhi from New York. You?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>

<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Gandhi </SPEAKER>

</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
From New York.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Gandhi </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Uh, Marco from Illinois.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Gandhi </SPEAKER>
Okay, Mark. Uh,  I think it's fresh topic for tonight.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Yeah, yeah. Good topic. It's a good topic.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Gandhi </SPEAKER>
So what do you think?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Well,  um, I would- I would have to start- -- I would have to start,
generally, in stating- -- stating what I think is the problem and -- -with
the Middle East and what- For me, one of the major problems is the
fact that -- the -- United States government gives so much aid to the
state of Israel.  In which,  the state of Israel buys -- many expensive
military weapons,  ah, which is used to -- oppress and -- to kill a lot of
Palestinians.  So, for me, that's -- the- that's essentially the root of
the problem.  And, um, Yasser Arafat was kind of in a difficult
position, because you have these,  um, incredibly -- oppressed and in
some ways imprisoned,  uh, Palestinians,  and if -- Arafat hadn't, um,
tried to stand up -- and help them and- and fight for their rights,
then -- m- they wouldn't have respected Arafat,  but then again, you
know, he couldn't be too friendly with the West,  um,  and, um, and
so he did the best he could, I think. It's a difficult -- leadership
role.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Gandhi </SPEAKER>
Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Yeah.  Um,  what do- Well, how about you?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Gandhi </SPEAKER>
I think,  yeah, more or less, I c- I agree with what you said. It's
almost, this is my view as well.  And the question is,  what next?  I
mean,  some idea -- from Israeli side, they were saying -- he was a
problem,  and if he goes, everything will be quite easy.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Gandhi </SPEAKER>
Fine.  Now he's not in anymore.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Gandhi </SPEAKER>
So, let us wait and see.  Hope.  If he was a problem himself,  hope
-uh,  the coming one -- will be in a good -- position to negotiate with
the other side, Israel, and then -- peace can be achieved.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Gandhi </SPEAKER>
Uh,  we have to wait and see, but,  uh,  it seems it's not easy.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
But, I,  eh, I get the feeling that- -- It's almost- -- The peace process-
We can't put it on -- the ro- or the- -- the whole responsibility of the
pre- -- peace process can't be the leader of -- a- -- a group that is- -- I
don't know, in my view,  has -- not ver- not very many resources to
fight- -- to fight this -- battle that -- their trying to fight against -- a
government that has taken away a lot of their land,  that,  you know,
doesn't allow them to really move around in their own country.  So,
unless that -- stops,  the, um,  the leader of the Palestinians -- really
can't do too much -- to further the peace process, because -- there are -- a
lot of bad things happening to the people -- of that -- leader.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Gandhi </SPEAKER>
That's correct, as well.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Yeah, so it's- -- it's kind of, it's- -- it seems like the, um,  the
media, at least in the United States, is -- putting all of this -- focus
and responsibility on the leader of the Palestinians, as if it was
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Gandhi </SPEAKER>
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Arafat's fault that any of- -- any of the violence was caused.  So,  it
seems like an unfair treatment -- of- -- of,  you know, the leader of -- the
Palestinian people.  Um,  yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Gandhi </SPEAKER>
Yes. That's absolutely correct. Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Yeah.  Hm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Gandhi </SPEAKER>
Actually, it- it's a good topic to be choosing, I mean,  uh, because
it's one of the fresh topics.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Gandhi </SPEAKER>
How long have you been with the study?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Uh, this is probably my tenth or eleventh conversation.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Gandhi </SPEAKER>
Tenth, eleven. Almost the same like me. So, the other -- days, which one
was quite interesting to you?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Um,  well, there's been a couple where -- they've- they talked about the
Cabinet -- for -- Bush, and Bush has been,  um,  you know,  selecting new
Cabinet members and -- all of the new members are people that I'm- I
don't really know very well.  So, there's been some topics where I'm-
I didn't have very much information.  Other topics -- you know, usually
about the election that- -- that, um,  I did have -- a lot of things,  um,
to say.  Yeah.  Are you- are you, um,  are you from the United States,
or do you come from, uh-
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Gandhi </SPEAKER>
I came from the area, I'm from Egypt.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
You're from Egypt.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Gandhi </SPEAKER>
Yeah, so I'm- I'm quite, uh,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
So you-
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Gandhi </SPEAKER>
-cerned about, uh- -- uh, over there I mean.  People, actually, they are
