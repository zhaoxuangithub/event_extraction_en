5. Death of Arafat (1) Controversial PLO leader Yasser Arafat died in
a Paris hospital last week.  Do you think Arafat's death will help or
hurt the Israeli-Palestinian peace process?  Was Arafat a good leader?
What do you think US policy should be toward Palestine now that Arafat
has died? What, if anything, should the US do to be involved in the
Middle East peace process?

<SPEAKER> Ali </SPEAKER>
Hi.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mark </SPEAKER>
I- -- my name is Mark.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ali </SPEAKER>
My name is Ali,  uh,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mark </SPEAKER>
How you d-
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ali </SPEAKER>
from Pennsylvania.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mark </SPEAKER>
how you doing?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ali </SPEAKER>
I'm fine.  How are you?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mark </SPEAKER>
Good, good.  Not too bad.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ali </SPEAKER>
Uh, so let me ask you, do you think Arafat was, uh, a good leader or
not?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mark </SPEAKER>
Um,  to hi- -- yeah, I- -- I think he did what he thought -- was right for
his people.  I- I- -- I would say he was a good leader -- for- -- for, uh,
his people.  And as far as our involvement there, should be as little
as possible.  Just let them do -- what they,  you know, what they're
going to do -- and we should stay out of it ((just)) as -- much as we can.
Uh, this country seems to get involved too much in other people's
politics.  Should just let them do whatever they're going to do,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ali </SPEAKER>
Uh,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mark </SPEAKER>
you know.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ali </SPEAKER>
mm, by the way I am from Arab origin,  so I also have, uh,  uh, the
same opinion -- like you.  I believe he -- -- in my opinion he- he was a
good leader -- and, um,  I believe what,  eh, has to be done -- right now
is to ((apply)) -- the United Nations', uh,  decisions about the
conflict between Arab and Israel because there is -- -- there are a lot
of,  uh, decisions have been made -- have been made -- and this, uh-
For example, one of them was, uh, decision number two forty-two -- and
this was about -- the ha- establishing two- two countries,  one for
Israel and another one for Palestine.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mark </SPEAKER>
Right.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ali </SPEAKER>
So, if we -- -- eh, if United States,  Bush,  Israel ((told)) th- the
solution or to, uh,  to make the decision,  eh,  I think this will
solve -- the problem.  The -- unfortunately what happens right now- -- The
-- for example, which is -- little bit toward it's- it's interest.  For
example,  when there was, uh, like,  a -- decision against Iraq,  the
United States -- went directly -- to Iraq to -- -- for, eh,  uh,  an
invasion -- and -- for -- whatever reasons- -- she even was out, uh,  putting
any attention to the United Nations,  uh, like, uh,  approval.  She
did wha- what she want.  But, eh,  eh, for Israeli, Palestinian
conflict there's a lot of decisions that has to be -- applied but until
now -- she didn't put any pressure,  eh,  toward ((this and)) and I
believe this policy has been, uh,  this kind of policy,  eh,  um,  eh,
became more and more during -- eh, during, uh, eh, Bush -- -- President
Bush time.  For example, before, eh, during Clinton,  I believe at
that time -- Clinton was trying hard -- to solve this problem and I
believe at that time, if you remember,  um,  Yasser Arafat -- and, uh,
the prime minister of Israel, his name was Barak,  they met together
in the White House -- and -- they almost came to an agreement -- to solve
this problem -- and during Clinton, eh,  period -- they had, uh, this
((Oslo)) a- eh, agreement.  Most of the big problems between the two
parties,  they negotiated everything almost and there is -- there
were, like, final steps that have to be solved.  But, uh, I think if
there was, like,  the, um,  the same policy has to be followed after
Clinton.  I think -- everything would- -- -finished then- -- the -- I think
United States -- went to another direction and, eh,  they forgot about
this problem right now.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mark </SPEAKER>
Yeah, I g- eh, see, I don't,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ali </SPEAKER>
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mark </SPEAKER>
um, when- when policy is set by one -- -- by one president -- towards-
towards one thing,  it's usually -- followed through, if there is
something to follow through, by the -- next president in turn. He is
more or less obligated -- to continue,  uh, the process that was already
started -- but -- I think -- Bush's -- agenda -- is not -- towards that right now.
That is not his priority, I don't think.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ali </SPEAKER>
Yeah, I think so, yes.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mark </SPEAKER>
And, eh,  uh,  although, you know, it's been a long time -- that -- i-
they have both -- b- both Israel and Palestine, they both need a -- they
both need their own country -- and-
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ali </SPEAKER>
That's, uh, true because, uh,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mark </SPEAKER>
an- -- eh, y-
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ali </SPEAKER>
in the United Nations they have established -- eh, they made this
decision already.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mark </SPEAKER>
R- right, right.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ali </SPEAKER>
The -- uh, there, uh -- there has to be two countries, one of them for
Palestine,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mark </SPEAKER>
Right.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ali </SPEAKER>
and another one for Israeli but, uh,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mark </SPEAKER>
I- I- I agree a hundred percent, uh,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ali </SPEAKER>
because, eh, i-
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mark </SPEAKER>
eh,  but to get so involved in it. I think,  the people,  uh,  the
people that are in charge, the- eh, the people that run the
governments there -- do need to sit down an- and- and be in touch with
each other and if they need a mediator or something like that, that-
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ali </SPEAKER>
Which is played by U- United States. This is the mediator which, in my
opinion, is the one
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mark </SPEAKER>
R-
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ali </SPEAKER>
who has the power to convince both -- parties -- about-
</TURN>

Right. Right. Um, i- -- they -- in --

it's a -- -- eh, that i- -- that is what is need and un-
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ali </SPEAKER>
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mark </SPEAKER>
unfortunately they've been -- they've been trying to get this settled
and hashed out for -- twenty-five, thirty years now.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ali </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mark </SPEAKER>
Uh,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ali </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Mark </SPEAKER>
i- it's been a long time in coming and anything that's good is worth
waiting for, you know what I mean? Eh, I mean, that's what I've always
been told. And -- but-
