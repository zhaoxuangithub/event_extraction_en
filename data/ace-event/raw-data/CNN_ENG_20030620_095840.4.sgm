dog chapman was in the same truck you saw. at one point, the mexican
police busted both andrew luster and dwayne dog chapman, because they
don't like bounty hunters in mexico. chapman remains behind bars as we
speak in mexico. andrew luster, though arrived yesterday at los
angeles international airport on a commercial flight from mexico. as
soon as he arrived -- thoom being walked by the fbi to a van belonging
to the ventura county sheriff's folks. he was taken to a prison in
kearn county, california, about 100 miles from los angeles, a place
mostly known for its grapes. make of that what you may. heidi?
