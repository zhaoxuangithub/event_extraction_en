president bush is going to be meeting with several arab leaders. that
happens next hour in a summit focusing on an israeli-palestinian peace
initiative. mr. bush is expected to win support for his peace making
campaign in the middle east crisis. earlier today, he said a solution
should not be derailed by "a few people a few killers, a few
terrorists." joining us now to discuss that is rob sabati,ed a a an
adjunct professor at georgetown university. good to see you this
morning, professor. are you optimistic that president bush is actually
going to, at this time, take the steps and say what has to be said to
remove the skepticism that the arab leaders are bringing to the
summit?
