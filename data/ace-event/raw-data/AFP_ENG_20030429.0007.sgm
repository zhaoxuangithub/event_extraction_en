South Korea's ruling party faces call for dissolution

SEOUL, April 29 (AFP)

South Korea's ruling party is facing an internal reformist call for
dissolving itself to create a new group after a humiliating defeat at
last week's by-elections, party officials said Tuesday.

The ruling Millennium Democratic Party (MDP), founded by former
president Kim Dae-Jung, has suffered declining popularity since
President Roh Moo-Hyun took office in February.

A group of 18 reformist MDP lawmakers, mostly Roh's confidants,
demanded late Wednesday that the party be "constructively dissolved"
to create a new grouping, MDP officials said.

But the established MDP leadership has opposed the sudden overhaul,
they added.

Reformist MDP members, however, vowed to launch a preparatory
committee next month and to make "tangible progress" in the process
of forging a new party.

The internal dispute erupted after the MDP lost three parliamentary
seats in Thursday's by-elections.

The opposition Grand National Party (GNP) took two of the National
Assembly seats while a splinter reformist party got the third.

With the latest wins, the GNP increased its majority in the 272-seat
National Assembly to 153 seats against 101 for the MDP.

General elections are due in April next year.
