<SUBJECT> Dell sued for "bait and switch" and false promises </SUBJECT>

Dell is involved in a class action suit for "bait and switch", where a
nurse claims Dell switched parts and charged her for the more expensive
items, and for promising "easy credit" for which no one qualifies and
then charges ridiculously high interest rates.

It seems someone did not read the credit terms, before purchasing item,
"buyers' remorse". And lawyers trying to make a buck from it. Hope federal
tort reform gets passed by the congress, so we can get rid of these
charlatans.

i agree that the buyer probably didn't read the credit terms to find
themselves with an unexpected rate... i always see that "for qualified
customers" in all of their advertisements that probably releases them of any
wrong doing... but i also believe in the court systems so let it take its
course and see what happens. the only tort reform that i think should be
done is to cap fees that lawyers are allowed to extract for class action
suits. i feel that there is a valuable public service that comes from class
actions suits which is to keep companies on the straight and narrow so that
they avoid such actions... but from a monetary perspective the only real
winners from class actions are the lawyers. i remember once receiving a
fifty cent check in an envelope with postage of at least half that amount
for the great 17" monitor class action suit.

Then there was the class action suit against Gateway brought by some
Philadelphia lawyers a number of years ago. Gateway advertised and
stickered many of its 486 computers as "Pentium Ready", meaning that a
special Type 3 ZIF socket Pentium OverDrive could be installed and run.

Micronics designed the motherboards used by Gateway, and the basis of
the design was a prototype Pentium OverDrive with an internal
write-through cache, a more conservative cache design. Then Intel
changed the Pentium OverDrive, and the final version had a write-BACK
cache. When installed in a Gateway system, the chip ran slower than
slow, maybe about as fast as an IBM AT, and bus-mastering devices like
NICs and SCSI cards refused to work.

So the lawyers sued Gateway, and the settlement approved by the judge
consisted of megabucks for the lawyers and coupons to owners of Gateway
486 computers.  The coupon was good for $50 off on the purchase of a
Pentium OverDrive processor from Gateway, at its usual inflated prices
!!! So, let's see. What does a discount coupon for a processor I can't
use in my system do for me? I wonder how many people gleefully cashed in
their coupons and bought Pentium OverDrives from Gateway.

Intel eventually compensated by making available an "interposer", a
little socketed thingie installed between the Pentium OverDrive and the
ZIF socket.  The sole purpose of the interposer was to raise a signal on
the CPU to force its cache to operate in the write-thru mode which was
compatible with most ZIF Socket 3 486 motherboards.

Needless to say, this was the least successful "OverDrive" CPU ever done
by Intel. The 486-DX4 OverDrive was OK, as were several Socket 5 Pentium
OverDrives and the Socket 8 Pentium Pro OverDrive. Finally Intel gave up
on OverDrives... Ben Myers

Believe it or not there are companies that go over the line and need to be
hit with a stick called a law suit. It seems the fear of law suits is the
only thing that keeps some of these crooked companies in line. The
government sure doesn't have the resources or desire to pursue them so it's
left to the private sector to protect themselves. Lawyers are bounty
hunters of sorts. BTW, I hate lawyers but there are times that they are
useful. Some are sleazebags but that can be said of most professions.
There has to be at least a little threat of "let the company beware" to
maintain a balance otherwise it'll be open season on consumers.

The only people who profit from class actions are the lawyers.

Since companies are going to be sued in class action, regardless of the
merits of the case, the threat of a class action is not a detriment.

If you don't believe that, witness the Vioxx lawsuits. The company
making Vioxx determined it might increase mortality and pulled it from
the market. Because of that, it is being sued. The companies making
similar drugs (Celebrex and Bextra) did not pull their product from the
market. They are not being sued. Doing the right thing provides no
protection from class action.

All class actions do is enrich lawyers and raise costs to everyone. The
cost of class actions is factored into the cost of everything you buy.
