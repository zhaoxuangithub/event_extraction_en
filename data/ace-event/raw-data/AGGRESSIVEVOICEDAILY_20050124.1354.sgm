This past weekend marked the 32-year anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the
landmark Supreme Court decision that gave way for the imminent slaughter
of 43 million unborn children across the country in the name of "women's
rights."

Today, thousands of pro-life crusaders will participate in the March
for Life in Washington D.C., to honor the defenseless children and hope
for an eventual Supreme Court reversal.

A reversal would not only be a victory for those who value life, but
also for the woman once known as Jane Roe -- now a passionate pro-life
advocate trying to get the Supreme Court to overturn the case she once
represented.

Michelle Malkin has the goods on the March as well as links to other
resources.
