Apparently Carly made a lot of journalistic enemies during her six
hears at HP. Not only was the catalyst for her fall from grace a Fortune
article by Carol Loomis (who as far as I know is immortal -- she's been
writing for Fortune since 1954), but the anti-Carly brigades are out in
full force at Salon.com . This is getting a little harsh; she might have
messed up at HP (I refuse to call it by the new name, for now), but she
wasn't actively trying to destroy a great company and wreck the
shareholders. It just, well, happened. So, right, Carly was a bad
manager, and she eventually got what she deserved, but she isn't evil
incarnate.
