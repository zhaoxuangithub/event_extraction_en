Speaking of major campaign contributors, here's the most interesting
story to be culled from the Virginia Public Access Project. The single
largest political donor in the second half of 2004 was Sheila C.
Johnson, of the Plains, who made five contributions totaling $320,490. (
See CPAP profile .)

What's so special about Sheila Johnson? Not only is she developing
the Salamander Inn &amp; Spa in Fauquier County, and not only is she a
major philanthropist, but she was a co-founder of of Black Entertainment
Television with her ex-husband Robert L. Johnson. If you haven't figured
it out yet, she is an African-American. I know that doesn't fit the
dominant, minorities-are-still-disenfranchised narrative of the
mainstream media. But the Old Dominion has come a long way, in my humble
opinion, when the biggest campaign contributor in the state is African
American.

You know we've come along way when African Americans aren't just
winning elected office, as former Gov. Douglas Wilder did, but they're
bankrolling candidates for office-- white candidates for office.
Johnson's donations last year included $287,490 for Domocratic
gubernatorial hopeful Tim Kaine.
