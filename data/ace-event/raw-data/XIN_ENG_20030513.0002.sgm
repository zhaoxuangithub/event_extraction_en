BOGOTA, May 12 (Xinhua)

The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) said Monday that it
was prepared to exchange prisoners with the government despite the
death of 10 hostages held by the rebel group.

The FARC sought the exchange of more than 70 politicians, soldiers
and policemen in its control for nearly 500 rebels imprisoned by the
government, said Luis Devia, also known as Raul Reyes, a FARC leader,
in a letter sent to the program Noticias Uno.

On May 5, 10 hostages held by the FARC were killed during an attempt
to rescue them by the army.

The victims were Antioquia Governor Guillermo Gaviria, former Defense
Minister Gilberto Echeverry and eight soldiers.

Reyes said in his letter that the "guerrilla units are in the moral
obligation of saving and protecting lives and physical integrity of
their prisoners."

The rebels "in any case cannot allow to have its prisoners to be
taken away by enemy forces without a military response," he added.

The 17,000-strong FARC, the largest guerrilla force in Colombia, has
been fighting a war against the government for more than 40 years,
leaving 400,000 dead. It is still holding hundreds of hostages
including three Americans.
