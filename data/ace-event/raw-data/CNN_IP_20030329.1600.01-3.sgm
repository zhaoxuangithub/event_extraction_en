I hope they get a little rest. When we come back, one of the many sad
aspects of this war, humanitarian aid rushed to people who need it but
not everybody gets what they came for. Slowly humanitarian aid is rolling
into southern Iraq but dramatic scenes like this one of a crowd tearing
into the supplies on a convoy truck only underscores how desperate the
need is. Correspondent Martin Geissler files this report from the Iraqi
town of Safwan.

<SPEAKER> MARTIN GEISSLER, CNN CORRESPONDENT </SPEAKER>
As our convoy rolled through southern Iraq the desperation of the people
here soon became evident. In trucks and on foot they came to the town of
Safwan. These people have been without food or water supplies since the
war began. Now they are desperate. Within seconds the Kuwaiti aid workers
who had organized this trip were overpowered by the mob. These desperate
scenes are exactly what the aide agencies wanted to avoid. This is
survival of the fittest. Only the healthy and strong can get to the food.
The weak and the ill are left with nothing. Despite this effort to help
the Iraqi people, resentment is never far away.

<SPEAKER> UNIDENTIFIED MALE </SPEAKER>
We hate U.S. We hate British, England. We hate any state in war here.

<SPEAKER> GEISSLER </SPEAKER>
What do you think about Saddam's regime?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> UNIDENTIFIED MALE </SPEAKER>
Saddam's very good man.

<SPEAKER> GEISSLER </SPEAKER>
As the supplies ran out the mood swung from frantic to ugly. Delivery
drivers were threatened. One of the buses in our convoy was held up at
knifepoint. The troops have moved into Safwan. We, as a consequence, have
had to move out. It's simply too dangerous. This is a clear indication
that despite the coalition reassurances that this part of Iraq is safe
and despite the aid being brought into the people here, it is still a
very, very volatile area. Tonight here the strong are eating. The weak
still go hungry. Martin Geissler, ITV News, Safwan southern Iraq.

So many different pictures we are getting from across that country. Well,
they are making their voices heard at home and abroad. When we return,
Americans this weekend are marching against the war and in support of the
troops. We'll check out some of the demonstrations. Here in the United
States this weekend just as they did last weekend, anti-war protesters
taking to the street. In Los Angeles, the International Black Coalition
for Peace and Justice is sponsoring a rally for peace today.
Congresswoman Maxine Waters was among those scheduled to attend. In the
meantime further north in California, San Francisco is the setting today
for a rally aimed at boosting the moral of the American troops in the
Persian Gulf region. CNN's Rusty Dornin is with us from San Francisco.
Rusty, what sort of crowd is showing up there?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> RUSTY DORNIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT </SPEAKER>
Well Judy, this is the largest group really we've seen of the support the
troops rallies that have been over the last few weeks. Of course this is
the home of the anti- war demonstrations stemming back to the Vietnam War
but there are close to between 500 and 1,000 people. I'm getting various
estimates on the crowd. We did want to show you an interesting thing
here. Some folks are showing some solidarity with the speakers here.
You're looking at some of San Francisco's police department's officers. I
did ask them why they did that. They said they were wearing skullcaps so
they decided to adopt this to show solidarity. They said the department
has not made any statement about whether they think that's all right or
not. This has been a very peaceful demonstration. As I said, the officers
did tell me that this is the largest pro-troops demonstration that has
ever been in San Francisco since the Vietnam War. So far, very peaceful.
As I said, there have been a few verbal exchanges but one of the most
enthusiastically received speakers here was Bessam Al-Husaini, an Iraqi
American. He's with the Iraqi American Council. How do you feel about
supporting the troops? How does the Iraqi American Council feel?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> BESSAM AL-HUSAINI, IRAQI AMERICAN COUNCIL </SPEAKER>
Well the Iraqi American have been waiting for this liberation and they
want to get rid of Saddam so bad and they will have to take it the way
it's been offered to us.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> DORNIN </SPEAKER>
How do you feel though seeing pictures of civilians injured in the
bombings?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> AL-HUSAINI </SPEAKER>
We get reports that these civilians especially in the (INAUDIBLE)
population have been attacked by the Iraqi regime themselves so they
can't blame the American and said look what the American doing to us. He
would love to see this and would draw on this emotion from the Arab world
and the European country.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> DORNIN </SPEAKER>
Now you said you did talk to your family in Baghdad as well and they also
are somewhat suspicious of the Americans.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> AL-HUSAINI </SPEAKER>
Well, I mean the Iraqi people have been the primary victim from the whole
thing. Yeah my family, you know, still in fear. You know they stay in one
room. They boarded all the - all the windows and they built with a brick
one of the windows facing the street. I mean yes, you know, my prayer to
them but we can only do so much. Hopefully it will be a short war. It
will be attack the Iraqi regime. We can live in liberty and freedom soon.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> DORNIN </SPEAKER>
Now I understand some of the people here have been threatened by anti-war
protesters. Have you had anyone either threatening you or ...
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> AL-HUSAINI </SPEAKER>
No, no problem. This has been a very peaceful demonstration.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> DORNIN </SPEAKER>
OK. Thank you very much.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> AL-HUSAINI </SPEAKER>
Thank you.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> DORNIN </SPEAKER>
Bessam Al-Husaini here and it has been a very peaceful demonstration. It
is wrapping up this afternoon and it looks like the civil disobedience
acts by the anti-protesters are scheduled to get underway once again next
week. Judy ...
