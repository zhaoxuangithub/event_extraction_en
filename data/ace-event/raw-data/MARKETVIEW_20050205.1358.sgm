I really miss the days when a major international oil company could
basically buy some tiny, ill-established foreign government to get at
its natural resources. We've progressed a bit since then: Now, the third
world countries all have their own state oil companies, who are picking
apart the carcasses of once-private concerns. The Capital Spectator
reports on the latest: Not only China, but India's state oil company has
decided to get into the Yukos-dismemberment trade .
