None allowed in Pakistan for nefarious designs: minister
</HEADLINE>

ISLAMABAD, April 25 (Xinhua)

"No one would be allowed to live in Pakistan illegally and use its
land for achieving their nefarious designs," Information Minister
Sheikh Rashid Ahmed said on Friday.

Rashid Ahmed made the remarks when his attention was drawn to the
recent visit by Afghan President Hamid Karzai, according to the
Associated Press of Pakistan.

Rashid said that Pakistan has very good relations with the brotherly
country of Afghanistan.

When asked to comment on the trans-national gas pipeline projects, he
said, four countries including Qatar, Turkmenistan and Iran are
deliberating upon the projects which will go a long way in
strengthening the economies of the participating countries.

Earlier on Thursday, President Pervez Musharraf said Pakistan wants
peace and stability in Afghanistan as it would be in "our interest."

Pakistan, he said, would benefit immensely from stability in
Afghanistan as its trade with Central Asian countries will take place
through it.

Referring to al-Qaeda, Musharraf said that no non-Pakistani would be
allowed to live in Pakistan without proper documents.

"We have to see if their cause is Islamic or in Pakistan's interest
-- they have their own political agenda -- they should not harm
Pakistan's interests."
