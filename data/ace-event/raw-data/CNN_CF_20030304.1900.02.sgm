Interview With Ralph Nader, Donald Palmisano; Interview With 
Congressmen J.D. Hayworth, Bernie Sanders
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> NOVAK </SPEAKER>
Welcome back. Both the AMA and the Bush administration released reports
this week saying out of control trial lawyers are driving doctors out of
their practices all across the country. President Bush points this way
today, even the most frivolous of lawsuits cost money, premiums go up and
either way, the patient pays. We're debating malpractice reform with
consumer advocate Ralph Nader, and AMA President-Elect Dr. Ronald
Palmisano.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> BEGALA </SPEAKER>
Dr. Palmisano, again, thanks for staying with us through the break. Let
me set aside the hypocrisy of a man who became president because of a
lawsuit trying to eliminate everybody else's lawsuits, but instead focus
on his own experience. He was the governor of my state of Texas, where
there are a whole lot of doctors. It turns out that he didn't do any kind
of a job policing your profession at all when he was the governor of
Texas. Here's what the "Dallas Morning News" reported recently: "The
Texas State Board of Medical Examiners, the agency that pledges to
protect the public has granted second and third chances to surgeons who
are thrown out of hospitals because they botched operations. It has
forgiven physicians who overlook cancerous tumors, who maimed infants or
whose mistakes left women sterilized. It has refused in the last five
years to revoke the license of a single doctor for committing medical
errors. Thousands more may have been ignored over the last decade." That
is the Bush record in policing surgeons, why should we trust him now?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> PALMISANO </SPEAKER>
Well, first off...
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> BEGALA </SPEAKER>
Physicians generally, not just surgeons, forgive me.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> PALMISANO </SPEAKER>
Sure. What we need to do is to make sure that state boards, number one,
have adequate funding. The AMA supports that. If there are any bad
doctors we want them removed from the practice of medicine. But it's
also...
</TURN>
(CROSSTALK)
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> BEGALA </SPEAKER>
... bad doctors?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> PALMISANO </SPEAKER>
Well, it's also unfair to make a judgment without knowing all of the
facts of the case. Because someone pays money in a case, the insurance
company may pay money because they're afraid there's is going to be a
giant award in this case because of this broken liability system. Troy
Brennan (ph) of Harvard said there's no correlation with negligence, only
with disability. So let's look at all of the facts, but give everybody
due process here in America before we criticize.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> NADER </SPEAKER>
Actually, Troy Brennan, the same doctor at Harvard Public School of
Health said the issue is not to fuel lawsuits, it's too many. Less than
10 percent of the victims of medical malpractice, and we're talking about
horrific injuries here, even file a claim. Even file a claim. And the
entire pay-out to all of the victims that get a little money, not the 90
percent who never file a claim, amounts to less than what we spend on dog
food. On dog food. It's about $5.4 billion is the pay-out. That's a
fraction of physician income. It's a fraction of the health care expense
of 1.4 trillion.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> PALMISANO </SPEAKER>
What we have to do is look at all the facts and have balance here. That's
what the people in Congress have to do. They have to make sure that
whatever they decide keeps doctors in practice and patients having access
to care.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> NADER </SPEAKER>
Doctors are going...
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> PALMISANO </SPEAKER>
But let me - but let me - wait...
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> NADER </SPEAKER>
Doctors are leaving practice because of insurance premium, right? Is that
right? They don't abandon their patients, except for the high premiums of
a few specialties?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> PALMISANO </SPEAKER>
Because of the premiums. But first of all let me...
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> NADER </SPEAKER>
Why don't you crack down on the insurance companies?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> PALMISANO </SPEAKER>
No. Let's talk about the facts. Let's talk about the facts.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> NADER </SPEAKER>
That's the fact.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> PALMISANO </SPEAKER>
(UNINTELLIGIBLE) percent of the doctors are insured by physician-owned
insurance companies, the medical side. I was just in Oklahoma, they own
this insurance company. They are trying to do their very best. It's a
company not for profit. What happens here is that more money is being
paid out than comes in. And as far as the investment income, A.M. Bests
(ph) show that in the past five years, the investment income has been
stable at around 5 percent. Brown Brothers Harriman said that investments
did not precipitate the current crisis.
</TURN>
(CROSSTALK)
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> NADER </SPEAKER>
... payoffs have been stable, adjusted for inflation, National
Practitioners Databank (ph). Why do you want that to be secret? All of
the information about bad doctors in the National Practitioner bank, you,
the AMA wants to keep it secret from other doctors and other patients
around the country who want to know whether their doctor is on that list.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> NOVAK </SPEAKER>
Well, let's look at what the president is actually proposing for people
who have been harmed by a bad doctor. Let's listen to what he said to the
AMA today.
</TURN>
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> BUSH </SPEAKER>
If harmed by a doc, they ought to be able to recover their economic
costs, economic losses. They should be able to recover non- economic
damages as well. But for the sake of the system, non- economic damages
should be capped at $250,000.
</TURN>
(END VIDEO CLIP)
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> NOVAK </SPEAKER>
What in the world is wrong with that? Tell me what's wrong with that?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> NADER </SPEAKER>
What's wrong? Tell someone who had a double mastectomy, tell an infant
who's brain-damaged and has no economic loss that for the rest of their
lives they're going to get dribbled out $250,000 for their entire life
expectancy? Wait a minute. The head of AIG a few years ago was making
$250,000 every week.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> NOVAK </SPEAKER>
Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money, though. Not for
you, but for most people it's a lot of money.
</TURN>
(CROSSTALK)
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> NADER </SPEAKER>
These executives, why don't you tell...
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> PALMISANO </SPEAKER>
In California - wait, Mr. Nader. In California...
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> NADER </SPEAKER>
Why don't you cap insurance...
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> BEGALA </SPEAKER>
Mr. Palmisano, go ahead.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> PALMISANO </SPEAKER>
Give me a moment, please.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> NADER </SPEAKER>
Go ahead, go ahead.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> PALMISANO </SPEAKER>
In California where they have this law, it caps the non-economics, the
ones you can't quantify. There are awards in 10 million, 20 million, $30
million in California for economic. So all medicals, all rehabilitation,
care services in the home, lost wages...
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> NOVAK </SPEAKER>
No, no, no. I've got to ask Mr. Nader, we are almost out of time. Doug
Friedman (ph), who ran Jesse Ventura's campaign for governor four years
ago, says he wants you to run for president again. I know you're saying
it's much too early to run for president. But one simple question, Ralph,
will you consider another run for president?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> NADER </SPEAKER>
Much too early to consider. I am concerned about Donald Zook (ph), who's
head of a medical malpractice insurance company, a big one in the West,
saying that his insurance company executive colleagues should not blame
the tort injury system. He said that your problem of jacking up these
insurance rates is self-inflicted. Here's an insurance company executive
who is saying that.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> PALMISANO </SPEAKER>
Well, Mr. Zook is one executive you are quoting. What we need to do is
look at all of the people who don't have doctors...
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> NADER </SPEAKER>
Hey, let's get some agreement. Should we get some agreement?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> PALMISANO </SPEAKER>
What...
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> NADER </SPEAKER>
Do you want to really crack down on the bad doctors?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> PALMISANO </SPEAKER>
We want to crack down on the attorneys who file frivolous suits.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> NADER </SPEAKER>
Fine. Fine.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> PALMISANO </SPEAKER>
Seventy percent of the cases filed are told there's no payment. What kind
of peer review is that?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> NADER </SPEAKER>
Wait. Wait. Do you want to crack down on the bad doctors? You're in AMA.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> PALMISANO </SPEAKER>
We definitely want to crack down on bad doctors. But...(CROSSTALK)
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> NADER </SPEAKER>
Do you want to control insurance rates?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> PALMISANO </SPEAKER>
We want the free market to dictate what is done.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> BEGALA </SPEAKER>
The free market actually dictates we have got to sell some commercials
here on CNN or we're all out of...
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> PALMISANO </SPEAKER>
Thanks. Privilege to be here.
