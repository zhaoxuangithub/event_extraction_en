11. Holiday Traditions: The holiday season is right around the
corner. Who do you like to celebrate with during the holidays? Do you go
to a lot of parties with friends, neighbors, co-workers or family
members? Are there people you see during the holidays that you don't see
during the rest of the year? Do you travel to meet up with family or
friends during the holidays? Where do you go and who do you visit?

</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Carol </SPEAKER>
Oh, you're young.  Yeah, you're too young.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Britt </SPEAKER>
But um, actually, this year I -we're going -- uh My parents are also
divorced, so it was always difficult because we had to, like, split
Christmas.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Carol </SPEAKER>
Sure.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Britt </SPEAKER>
So we would do, like, New Years with -I mean, um, Christmas Eve with
one set of, you know,  parents, and then Christmas day with the other.
So, yeah, it was always tough, so we never really went anywhere. But,
this year is, like,  all the children are old enough now that we don't
have to split Christmas, so-
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Carol </SPEAKER>
Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Britt </SPEAKER>
We're actually, um, going to France for Christmas to have with my
aunt, so-

Thank you. Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Carol </SPEAKER>
That's exciting.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Britt </SPEAKER>
So it's going to be a little different -- this year especially, because
it's -- going to be a lot of people -some people I don't even know, and
um-

<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Carol </SPEAKER>
Sure.  Yeah, but a beautiful country.

January.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Carol </SPEAKER>
What type of work do you do?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Britt </SPEAKER>
Um, I work for a transportation planning consulting firm.  It's -- very
different. It takes a while to explain, too, it's just kind of like-
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Carol </SPEAKER>
Sounds kind of crazy.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Britt </SPEAKER>
Yeah, it's, eh, we're not -- an architecture firm or a, or a
construction firm, and were not engineering either. We kind of
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Carol </SPEAKER>
Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Britt </SPEAKER>
so the work that comes -- beforehand. So, like, when,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Carol </SPEAKER>
Okay.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Britt </SPEAKER>
you know, um,  I don't know, say New Jersey Transit Authority comes to
us and says, we want a,  you know-
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Carol </SPEAKER>
Mhm.  Oh.  Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Britt </SPEAKER>

</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Carol </SPEAKER>
Oh, that's different.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Britt </SPEAKER>
Yeah, and it
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Carol </SPEAKER>
Well, I'm a teacher.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Britt </SPEAKER>
Oh, great. What -- what do you teach?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Carol </SPEAKER>
Uh, I teach adult high school right now. I'm retired from full-time
teaching,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Britt </SPEAKER>
Oh, wow.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Carol </SPEAKER>

nights a week.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Britt </SPEAKER>
Oh, great.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Carol </SPEAKER>

</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Britt </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Carol </SPEAKER>
But it's fun. I- I really enjoy it -- a lot.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Britt </SPEAKER>
I always wanted to be teacher. My parents kind of talked me out of it.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Carol </SPEAKER>
They were smart.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Britt </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Carol </SPEAKER>
I talked my daughter out of it. No, I wouldn't recommend anyone going
into teaching now.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Britt </SPEAKER>
Really?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Carol </SPEAKER>
It's changed so dramatically.  Yeah.  I would not rec- as a matter of
fact I don't recommend it
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Britt </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Carol </SPEAKER>
to anybody.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Britt </SPEAKER>
Well, when I was- I wanted to be a music teacher and that would've
been even harder
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Carol </SPEAKER>
Oh god, yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Britt </SPEAKER>
I think because the- one, you get laid off first pr- you know, first
person to get laid off is going to be the arts and
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Carol </SPEAKER>
Mhm.  That's right.  And that's what ha- what is happening.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Britt </SPEAKER>
which makes me so upset. Oh, I c- it drives my crazy, like,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Carol </SPEAKER>
Uh-huh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Britt </SPEAKER>
i- you know, art and music are so
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Carol </SPEAKER>
They're important.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Britt </SPEAKER>
so important to your culture and, you know, wh- having be a well
rounded person. I mean, you can't do it,  at least you could try, you
know, and you- I just- -- not everything can be academic, you know.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Carol </SPEAKER>
That's right.  Absolutely.
