<SUBJECT> Clear Channel worships Our Great Fuehrer....er....Leader </SUBJECT>

One of the hallmarks of a good totalitarian leader is the tendency to
jump into a military uniform at the drop of a hat (although stuffing
socks in your crotch while doing it is an innovation apparently
dreamed up by George W. Bush).

Another is to make sure there are plenty of very big pictures of
yourself all over the place.

Fortunately for Our Great Leader he doesn't have to do this himself,
because he's got one of the biggest media companies in the country to
do it for him.

Clear Channel - home to Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity - owns over
1,200 radio stations and 57 television stations in America.

They also own a lot of billboards.

Want to know what they do with their billboards when nobody's paying
to use them?

The picture was taken off I-4 north of downtown Orlando by DUer
davhill.

The text at the bottom reads, "Not authorized by any candidate or
candidate's committee. A political public service message brought to
you by Clear Channel."

Did you know that one of the largest media companies in the country
was in the business of bringing you "political public service
messages?"

Me either.

Truth be told we originally thought that this picture was fake, but we
had to eat crow when Clear Channel released a statement which read in
part, "Clear Channel Outdoor markets are operated locally.

Local managers determine what copy to use when a location has time
that is not sold to an advertiser."

That statement was made after Clear Channel denied the billboard
existed, of course.

Florida's not the only state to suffer Clear Channel's "political
public service messages" by the way - check out this one from Arizona:

Curse you, liberal media!
