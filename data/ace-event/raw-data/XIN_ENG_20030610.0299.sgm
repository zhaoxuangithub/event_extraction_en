WASHINGTON, June 10 (Xinhua)

Sam Waksal, founder of the US pharmaceutical company ImClone Systems
was sentenced to 87 months in prison Tuesday for insider trading.

Waksal was also ordered to pay more than 4 million dollars in fines
and back taxes. This order came after about two hours' legal
proceedings at the Manhattan courthouse in New York, according to a
TV report.

Before the sentence, there had been speculations among analysts on
whether Waksal would get leniency because his company has been
working on researches of cancer drugs, a good endeavor in the eyes of
many people.

ImClone's Erbitux drug has been recently accepted to be effective in
helping cancer patients. But the order just released from the
courthouse in New York has obviously separated Waksal's good efforts
in making new drugs from his legal problems.

Amid the financial storms last year and the ensuing cracking down on
corporate malfeasance, Waksal pleaded guilty in October to charges
involving his efforts to sell a huge block of his company' s stock in
late 2001.

The attempt to sell the shares were just before ImClone shares
plunged on the news that the Food and Drug Administration rejected
ImClone's application to sell the experimental cancer drug, Erbitux.

This incident then triggered legal investigations, which also
included the case of a US media and domestic design diva, Martha
Stewart.
