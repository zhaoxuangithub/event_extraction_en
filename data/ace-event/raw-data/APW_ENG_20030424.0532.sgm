North Korea tough talk provides backdrop for second day of nuclear
talks with United States, China

Talks between North Korea, the United States and China ended Thursday
with U.S. State Department officials saying it was uncertain whether
discussions on Pyongyang's nuclear program would continue.

Although North Korea accused the United States of leading the region
toward war in its state media, U.S. officials denied reports the
talks had broken down. North Korea also hinted during the meetings
that they have nuclear weapons and may conduct a test, a U.S.
official said.

Earlier, Secretary of State Colin Powell had told a gathering of
experts from the Asia-Pacific region that the talks had concluded,
leaving the impression there would not be a third day of discussions
on Friday.

Powell also expressed hope that South Korea and Japan will be able to
participate ``when and if'' there is another round of talks.

``North Korea should not leave the meetings having the slightest
impression that they might force us to make a concession we would not
otherwise make,'' he added.

But U.S. State Department officials, asking not to be identified,
said there may be more meetings on Friday. They said reports of a
breakdown in the talks were a ``misrepresentation.''

One official said: ``We had the opportunity to say what we needed to
say and to hear what the North Koreans wanted to tell us.''

A U.S. official said the North Koreans implied during the talks that
they have nuclear weapons and that they may conduct a test. But the
official said there are no indications a test is imminent. He
acknowledged that preparations for an underground test could be
concealed.

According to the official, a North Korean nuclear detonation would
deplete by half their estimated stockpile of two weapons.

In Beijing, chief U.S. negotiator, Assistant Secretary of State James
Kelly, declined to answer questions, saying only the sides ``had
talks.''

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao refused to provide
details, but said the talks were ``conducive to mutual understanding
and finding ways to resolve the North Korean nuclear question
peacefully.''

Discussions were scheduled to end Friday, when Kelly was to fly to
Seoul the same day to meet with South Korean officials.

The talks are the first high-level U.S.-North Korean contact since
tensions over the North's nuclear program spiked six months ago over
Washington's claim that the North said in October it was trying to
develop nuclear weapons in violation of a 1994 pledge. The North has
disputed the U.S. claim.

Washington and its allies suspended fuel shipments to North Korea as
punishment. The North retaliated by withdrawing from the nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty, expelling U.N. inspectors and restarting a
plutonium-producing reactor.

North Korea, which is seeking a guarantee from the United States that
it won't be attacked, ratcheted up the threat of conflict in a
statement issued by its official Korean Central News Agency accusing
Washington of escalating tensions.

The North's leaders fear they could be the next target for U.S.
military action.

``The situation on the Korean Peninsula is so tense that a war may
break out any moment due to the U.S. moves,'' the KCNA statement
said.

It said relations with the United States had hit ``rock bottom''
because U.S. President George W. Bush named North Korea as part of an
``axis of evil,'' along with Iran and Iraq.

KCNA said the war in Iraq had shown the only way for a country to
protect itself was to have a strong military deterrent. Officials
from Seoul and Washington say the swift U.S.-led victory in Iraq
prompted North Korea to agree to the nuclear talks.

North Korea said the ``master key'' for successful talks was for the
United States to drop its hostile policy toward Pyongyang.

In a likely reference to North Korea's demand for a nonaggression
treaty with Washington, KCNA said: ``The U.S. should settle the talks
from a sincere stand and strive to settle the essential issue.''

Washington has refused to offer a formal treaty but says it would
consider some sort of written assurance.

The North also likely wants aid for its economy, which has been
crippled by the loss of Soviet subsidies and years of drought and
mismanagement.

North Korea and China fought against the United States in the 1950-53
Korean War, which ended without a peace treaty. North Korea and
Washington have no formal relations and are still technically at war.

China, the North's ally and major aid donor, says it doesn't want
Pyongyang to acquire nuclear weapons and has appealed for a
negotiated settlement to the crisis.

A U.S. official praised the Chinese contribution to the discussions.
He said China's delegate specifically called for a denuclearized
Korean Peninsula and made specific reference to a 1992 promise
Pyongyang made to South Korea not to develop nuclear weapons.

Ri Gun, deputy director of American affairs for North Korea's Foreign
Ministry is representing North Korea at the talks. China's delegation
is led by Fu Ying, director general of the Asian Affairs Department
of its Foreign Ministry.
