For my holiday post, I offer a message of hope for the business
world.

In 1994, I was a graduate student in Boston. I was asked to moderate
a panel discussion on social entrepreneurship for a conference at
Harvard Business School. The conference was being held by a new group
called Students for Responsible Business. I expected to see a small
gathering of idealistic, slightly naive MBA students. What I found was a
packed room of 200 intelligent, practical,driven idealists. These
students were determined to figure out how to use business as a driver
for positive social change. I left that room with my eyes open to the
possibilities presented by these future business leaders.

Fast forward 10 years. Students for Responsible Business is now
called Net Impact . In 2004, I had the opportunity to attend their
conference hosted by The University of Texas McCombs Business School.
Net Impact had grown to include over 9,000 MBA students and alumni.
Approximately 900 people attended the 2004 conference. The buzz words
flying around the conference included social entrepreneurship,
sustainable profitability, working with passion. I met student after
student intent on harnessing the forces of business and capitalism to
improve the world. These students understand that business is a powerful
lever of change in this world.

Recently business schools have received their share of criticism for
turning out graduates who seem to have lost sight of their
responsibility for ethical action. I can tell you that I am seeing a
powerful groundswell of change coming from within business schools. It
is not coming from the faculty, or the alumni, or the administration.
All these groups continue to pay lipservice to topics of social
responsibility while avoiding any real innovations in the student
experiences. The change is being demanded by the students. A little
secret of business schools is that MBA students have an immense amount
of sway. Few choose to use it, but if they want they can fundamentally
change their school. Right now students at business schools are asking
for more discussion of these topics in classes, are initiating service
projects, forming support group for social entrepreneurs, inviting
speakers to campus to discuss sustainability, social investing,
non-profit innovations, etc. Net Impact is often at the center of these
efforts.

These are not isolated events...This is a revolution from within. I
have no doubt that in 10 years we will see the vast positive impact that
these students are having in the world of business and society at large.

In 1776 Adam Smith spoke of enlightened self-interest in The Wealth
of Nations . I often feel that we have conveniently forgotten his
emphasis on enlightened which he defined as being committed to being a
good citizen and steward of society. I am excited and hopeful that this
new generation of business leaders will bring this emphasis front and
center.

If you are an MBA student and want a good reference for comparing how
MBA programs integrate issues of sustainability and social
responsibility into the student experience a good place to start is the
Beyond Grey Pinstripes report produced by The Aspen Institute .

Happy Holidays to everyone!!
