the coroner examining the remains of two bodies recovered
near san francisco bay yesterday was unable to determine
the cause of death. police are now considering the
possibility that the remains are those of laci peterson and
her unborn child. peterson disappeared on christmas eve of
last year. paul vercammen joins me now from martinez,
california, with the latest for us. paul?
</TURN>
<TURN>
reporter: well, lou, one thing that the coroner has been
able to determine is that the skeletal remains are those of
one, an adult female, and two, the remains of the almost
full-term baby boy. and of course, this is significant
because laci peterson, when she disappeared from her
modesto home, was 7 1/2 months pregnant. that was on
christmas eve. her husband, scott, at the time said that he
was fishing in the berkeley marina. now, in a strange twist
in all of this, just yesterday separate from the skeletal
remains i alluded to earlier a man hiking near the berkeley
marina found a bone, and they are now looking at that as
another possible lead in this case.
</TURN>
<TURN>
this person came across the bone at the shore. he brought
it home and contacted the authorities, and we took
possession of it.
</TURN>
<TURN>
and you're trying to connect it to the other --
</TURN>
<TURN>
well, we're trying to find out if it's a human bone and
whether or not it is related to the others.
</TURN>
<TURN>
reporter: and yet another reason why that bone could be a
key link, there are reports that have surfaced that in
terms of the female remains that were found the skeleton
was not completely intact. now this case is also taking on
a rather, we should say, almost a tv episodic forensic
pathology angle because they're going to bring in an expert
on what's called alufating decay, and basically this person
is going to come in here and look at the body. this is in
the damage aspect of it. and they say these experts will be
able to tell how long the body had been in there and if the
remains of the almost full-term baby boy were inside the
female's remains at the time of death. also, the coroner
could know right now but is not saying if there was some
sort of trauma to either of these skeletons, for example,
if they could see the bone compromised in some way they
could tell if there had been a stab or a shooting. we may
learn a lot more on this in just 15 minutes. that's because
modesto police have scheduled a news conference and while
they may not say much at all they could also drop some
major bomb shells, lou. reporting live from martinez,
california, i'm paul vercammen, now back to you.
</TURN>
<TURN>
paul, let me ask you, if i may, quickly, are we expecting
-- is there any reason for us to expect that there would be
the ability to identify those remains as a result of these
autopsies this afternoon?
</TURN>
<TURN>
reporter: it sounds like all of this will be too quick, and
it seems underlying all this is there could be an absence
of dental records. that's particularly important for the
adult female remains. so now they're going to have to turn
to dna, and that's why they're calling in these experts.
some dna testing can be very quick, but sometimes it can
take up to weeks, even more, lou.
</TURN>
<TURN>
okay. paul vercammen, thank you very much. as paul just
reported, the modesto, california police department will be
holding a news conference just a few minutes from now, and
cnn of course will be carrying that news conference live.
stay with us.
