<SUBJECT> member of the uacc </SUBJECT>

there is a lady by the name of Irene Sokolas that is selling on Ebay
under VARIOUS names. She is saying she's a member of the UACC. She
is selling FORGERIES. I have contacted the UACC and told them about
it so they can check the auctions (she's been doing this a long time)
and to tell me if she's actually a registered member.

I would suggest everyone read the body of the entire item they're
bidding on. EVERYTHING. If you see her name, stay clear. No matter
WHICH ID she's using. Also, I have seen in the past, others reselling
items usuing her COA's. Be careful.

I am miffed the UACC would not check into people before allowing them
to be members if in fact she is a member. But I will reserve
judgement till they respond.

This makes one really skeptical. But if you see a UACC member on
Ebay, don't automatically assume they are legit. Contact the UACC
before buying and ask if they are a member. If you suspect something
is fake, do not take it for granted it's legit because a UACC number
is attached to it. In cases where the member claims and IS a UACC
member, still question and then if you suspect there are a number of
fakes by that person, do NOT hesitate to let the UACC and Ebay know.

Hope I spared someone here of potential grief and saved someone some
money!

The only thing that being a UACC member means is that they paid
membership dues. It doesn't make them honest sellers. UACC registered
dealers are more carefully checked out and should be considered to be
honest. Of course, there are exceptions to everything. Here is a link
to the list of UACC registered dealers:
