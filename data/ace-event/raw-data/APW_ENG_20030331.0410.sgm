COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP)

Former Danish international Stig Toefting dropped his appeal of an
assault conviction and will serve a four-month jail sentence,
Denmark's TV2 reported Monday.

Toefting was convicted in October 2002 of assaulting a pair of
restaurant workers during a night out with national squad teammates
in the capital, Copenhagen. He was sentenced to four months in
prison, but appealed. The hearing was scheduled for April 10.

TV2, quoting Toefting's lawyer Anders Nemeth, reported that that
33-year-old midfielder was ready to serve his sentence immediately.

Neither Toefting or Nemeth were immediately available for comment.

Earlier this month, Toefting said English Premier League club Bolton
let him go so he could prepare for the appeal.

It was unclear whether Toefting would return to Bolton after serving
his sentence. The club said it wasn't aware of Toefting's decision to
drop his appeal.

Toefting transferred to Bolton in February 2002 from German club
Hamburg.

Toefting has been convicted before. In 1999 he was given a 20-day
suspended sentence for assaulting a fan who berated him for playing
with German club Duisburg.

The popular player  _  known for his temperament and the words ``No
Regret'' tattooed across his chest  _  retired from Denmark's
national team after it was knocked out in the second round of the
2002 World Cup.

Toefting joined the Danish squad in 1993 and has 41 caps.
