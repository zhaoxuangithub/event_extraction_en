It's always difficult to get used to a central fact of the modern
economy: The best new technology will keep getting better at an
absolutely astounding rate. Usually, the improvement curve flattens
pretty fast -- the usual auto industry/computer industry comparison
works just fine (According to the standard urban legend, Bill Gates
notes that "If we'd been making cars instead of software, you'd get 500
miles to the gallon, need an oil change every 250,000 miles, and be able
to replace your car for $200," to which a mythical GM executive replies
"Ah, but if Microsoft made cars, they'd crash three times a day, too!").

Anyway, a few announcements during the last two days underscore the
fact that the growth in memory and processing power for computers is far
from over: Hewlett-Packard is developing a new replacement for the
transistor , and a consortium of software companies is backing a new
technology that would allow discs to hold up to a terabyte of
information . No idea where this will end up: It's not altogether rare
that these announcements result in a very expensive project to develop
something that, for whatever reason, isn't worthwhile to consumers. But
it's important to remember that the status quo is never more than a
snapshot -- investing as though it's permanent is a recipe for disaster.
