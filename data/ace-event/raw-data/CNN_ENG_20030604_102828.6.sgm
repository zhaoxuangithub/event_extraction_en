in the african nation of nigeria, an islamic court delayed
the appeal of a woman condemned to death by stoning. the
court says it will not hear this case until late august.
the 31-year-old mother of three was convicted in march of
having sex outside of marriage. three other nigerians also
face stoning deaths for the same crime. the prosecution of
premarital or extramarital sex is not quite as rare as you
might think. our next guest this morning faced 100 lashes
for premarital sex in pakistan. she was there as a
journalist in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. she has written
about her experience in the book "tantrika" traveling the
road of divine love. a traveling reporter now on leave and
joins us to tell her story. thank you for coming in to
share this with us. as i understand it, you say you were
facing a sentence of 100 lashes, had not yet been sentenced
that?
