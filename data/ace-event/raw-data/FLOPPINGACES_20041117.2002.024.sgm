Chris Matthews, that idiot talking head over at MSNBC, said yesterday
about the terrorists we fought in Fallujah "a rival, I mean they're not
bad guys especially, just people who just disagree with us"....this just
amazes me, the complete idiocy of this waste of human sperm. These are
the same terrorists blowing up families, chopping off heads of
civilians, and the complete disregard for any human life and they just
disagree with us?

Tell that to the family of Margaret Hassan, the school teacher who
was brutally tortured and then slaughtered by these same guys, they
ain't so bad are they Chris Matthews? This women who was known for her
30 years of work in Iraq, distributing medicine, food and supplies to
Iraqis suffering under the sanctions of the 1990s.

British officials say they believe Hassan was a blindfolded woman
seen being shot in the head by a hooded militant on a video obtained but
not aired by the Arab television station Al-Jazeera. She would be the
first foreign woman to die in the wave of kidnappings in Iraq. No group
has claimed responsibility.

On Sunday, Marines found the mutilated body of what they believe was
a Western woman on a street in Fallujah during the U.S. assault on the
insurgent stronghold. The body, clothed in what appeared to be a purple,
velour dress, was wrapped in a blanket, with a blood-soaked black cloth
nearby. As of Tuesday night, the U.S. command said the body had not been
identified.

These are the reasons that none of these mothereffers should ever see
the light of day...they need to be all lined up and shot. Torturing this
poor women for what? WHAT? And we should treat them as enemy soldiers
under the Geneva Convention. Last I remember the convention applies to
countries that signed the document and the two countries must have
standing armies with uniforms....the Iraqi military is at our side, the
terrorists are not. Since when are terrorists soldiers? They are lower
then dogs.

Finally there is this written by a student of Mrs. Hassan She was my
English teacher

In the memory of my teacher and a fellow aid worker colleague Mrs. M.
Hassan

Mrs. Hassan was my English teacher in The British Council in Baghdad
in Al-Wazirya district, I remember her years ago with her Irish accent
telling me it's not Important how many words I must learn but the
pronunciation of the words I already knew must be perfected.

Mrs. Hassan speak s perfect Arabic and she has a heart of gold, she's
been killed by (men in pajamas), turn Iraq upside down and find them.
The Marines will find them, and when they do they shall die.
