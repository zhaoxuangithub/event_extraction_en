<SUBJECT> There is one Carousel organization again </SUBJECT>


I just received the latest issue of Merry-Go-Roundup, the quarterly
publication of the National Carousel Association
. In it was a blurb reporting that the American
Carousel Society had recently disbanded.

Some of you may be wondering why there were two carousel organizations
in the first place. The National Carousel Association was founded in
the early 1970's by a group of art historians and collectors, including
Frederick Fried, author of the 1964 book "A Pictorial History of The
Carousel" that single-handedly gave the classic hand-carved wooden
carousel the respect and appreciation it deserved. Other founders
included Charlotte Dinger, who was already a major collector of
carousel artwork at the time. The purpose of the NCA is "to promote
conservation, appreciation, knowledge and enjoyment of the art of the
classic wooden carousel and especially the preservation of complete
wooden carousels."

The organization attracted a wide range of members, including carousel
enthusiasts, owners/operators, theme and amusement parks, museums,
libraries, those in the entertainment/recreation industry, art
collectors and even auction houses, among others. It was the presence
of these last two named groups that would eventually stir up
controversy.

Thanks in large part to the NCA, the art of the carousel was receiving
a lot of public attention and appreciation that it had not enjoyed
before. However, this new and brighter spotlight on these antique rides
also had the unfortunate effect of enhancing the collectibility and
monetary value of operational carousels. They had become worth more
money dead (i.e. in pieces) than alive (i.e. functioning). As such,
during the 1980's many beautiful and unique wooden carousels would be
broken up at the auction block, as owners rushed to cash in on the
antique marketplace. The liability insurance crisis further aggravated
the situation, as amusement park operators sought to cut their losses,
while at the same time liquidate underperforming carousels to raise
capital for the purchase of newer and more profitable (thrill) rides.

Some collectors of carousel art and auction houses were accused of
using their NCA affiliation to gain information about vintage carousels
that they could target for breakup to their own personal profit, a
practice certainly contrary to the stated goals of the organization.
The increasing rift between the "preservationists" and "collectors"
would eventually boil over into an internal political struggle that
caused many in the collectors faction of the NCA to walk out of the
group, including founders such as Charlotte Dinger and others. The
preservationists would chose to remain with the NCA, including Fred
Fried.

At this time in the late 1970's, carousel artwork collector and printer
Marge Swenson was the editor of the NCA's Merry-Go-Roundup publication.
The political struggle that occurred within the NCA resulted in two
slates of officers being presented for approval to the membership,
something that was not supposed to happen. A thicker-than-usual issue
of the Roundup would be filled with accusations from both factions in
the group each accusing the other of improper behavior. Swenson herself
would also leave the NCA. Not much later, she began publishing her own
magazine called "Carousel Art", which was essentially a scholarly photo
album depicting different carvers and styles each month. Meanwhile,
those collectors who left the National Carousel Association banded
together to form the American Carousel Society (ACS), whose stated aims
of carousel preservation also recognized collectors as a positive asset
towards that goal.

For the next couple of decades, the two carousel organizations would
co-exist, each attracting its share of members. Some would actually
join both groups, and even attend both of their annual conventions.

During the mid-1980's Walter Louck would begin publishing "The Carousel
Trader", later renamed "The Carousel News &amp; Trader". This monthly
magazine would cover all angles and sides of the story of the carousel
and be well received by all carousel enthusiasts. About a decade later,
Carousel Art would suddenly cease publication. The NCA would continue
to issue the Roundup to its members.

The mid to late 1990's saw the passing of NCA founder Fred Fried, and
also that of Charlotte Dinger, both who represented the two opposite
points of view in the carousel preservation debate.

Coincidentally and amazingly, the art of building hand-carved carousels
(and even bandorgans) has been revived, with firms such as Carousel
Works and Carousel Magic again building the popular rides in classic
design. This development seems to have greatly alleviated the antique
marketplace pressures that have doomed so many legacy wooden carousels
over the past several decades.

The turn of the new millenium actually witnessesed a thaw in the
relationship between the National Carousel Association and American
Carousel Society, as newer and younger leadership took over from the
founding generation. The two groups decided that the bickering between
them was wasteful, conterproductive and pointless. There was talk of a
(re)merger but the regulations governing non-profits prevented that.
However, it was decided that NCA and ACS hold joint conventions to save
on costs to both the clubs and the members.

Just within the past couple of months though, the American Carousel
Society had determined that they did not have the funding to continue
with the operation of their organization and officially ceased to
exist.

So now, once again there is a single nationwide organization to join if
you love carousels!
