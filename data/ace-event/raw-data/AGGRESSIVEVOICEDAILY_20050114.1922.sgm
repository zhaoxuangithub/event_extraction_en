From the Associated Press : An atheist who tried to remove "under
God" from the Pledge of Allegiance lost a bid Friday to bar the saying
of a Christian prayer at President Bush's inauguration.

Newdow argued that saying a Christian prayer at the Jan. 20 ceremony
would violate the Constitution by forcing him to accept unwanted
religious beliefs.

Attorneys representing Bush and his inaugural committee argued that
prayers have been widely accepted at inaugurals for more than 200 years
and that Bush's decision to have a minister recite the invocation was a
personal choice the court had no power to prevent. Forcing him to accept
unwanted religious beliefs? No wonder you can't win an argument against
a secularist. They believe any inclusion of religious beliefs in one's
own personal ceremony is somehow an operation to indoctrinate the hoi
polloi.
