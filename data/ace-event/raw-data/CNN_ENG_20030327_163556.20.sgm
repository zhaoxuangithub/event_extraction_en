for some americans who find themselves spending hours on
end watching television coverage of the war, it can be hard
to break away. that is especially true if you have a loved
one in the war zone. but as our candy crowley reminds us,
life does and must go on.

reporter: spring-time and a game of catch on the washington
mall. a gentle breeze and a good meal beside the pacific
ocean. that other place, the one on tv all the time, might
as well be on another planet. and that may be the point.
</TURN>
<TURN>
we happen to be at a very nice spot by the beach where this
is a chance for people to get away from cnn coverage,
everything, and kind of relax
</TURN>
<TURN>
reporter: time to redefine normal again, which on the
homefront now seems to mean life as you live it only
weirder.
</TURN>
<TURN>
i'm amazed at how unaffected i am by things, how i'm still
coming to work and doing the same things and going for a
walk in the morning. and it just seems so strange to me
that it's almost a parallel universe.

<TURN>
more than 70 percent of americans say they are sad about
the war. the barber at hinsville georgia larries that.
</TURN>
<TURN>
they seem more depressed. a lot of them afraid they're
going to lose their jobs, you know, the economy is down and
all kind of stuff.
</TURN>
<TURN>
life on the homefront seems the same at farmer's market in
los angeles, but it's more angst ridden.
</TURN>
<TURN>
i don't think it's affecting our business as much as i was
worried that it would, but you never know it's going to
happen. if there's any kind of terrorism that happens here,
i think that would definitely put a damper on everything.

nationwide, people shopped less in the first week of the
war. sales fell 2 percent from the previous week. air
travel has fallen 10 mers since the war began and some
hotel chains say cancellations are up. 60 percent of the
people say they're watching the war.
</TURN>
<TURN>
my boyfriend has been watching the tv like every single
day, every time it comes on, he's watching it.
</TURN>
<TURN>
maybe fewer people are shoning because they're watching tv.
maybe fewer are flying because they worry about terrorism
or they worry about what the war will do to the economy or
maybe it's everything.
</TURN>
<TURN>
there's no one economic statistics to point to a downturn,
it's an overall feeling, a psychological feeling that
everything is frozen, everything is on hold. consumers
aren't spending, people aren't buying stock, everything is
