Microscopic microcap Everlast , mainly a maker of boxing equipment,
has soared over the last several days thanks to a licensing deal with
Jacques Moret allowing Moret to buy out their women's apparel license
for $30 million, on top of a $12.5 million payment now. In other words,
a competitor has decided that one segment of the company's business is
potentially worth $42.5 million. Investors have prudently valued the
remaining business -- the extremely well-known Everlast brand, the
possible new reality TV show, and most of the company's assets -- at a
negative $16.5 million. The company's stock would have to rise more than
50% from the current level to put a zero value on that business. And,
who knows? It might.
