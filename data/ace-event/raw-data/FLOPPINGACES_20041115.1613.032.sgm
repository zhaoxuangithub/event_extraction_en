Just reported from AP that Condi Rice has been chosen by President
Bush to become the new Secretary of State for his second term. I agree
with his choice and think she will make a much better Secretary then
Powell did. Her views are much more in step with the President then
Powell, although he was a true soldier and carried the message.

Plus, any lady who works out to Led Zeppelin and is a Football nut is
alright in my book.
