10. Death of Arafat (2) PLO leader PLO leader Yasser Arafat died in a
Paris hospital last week, after a lot of controversy surrounding his
illness and death.  What do you think caused his illness, and could it
have been something malicious (like poisoning)?  What do you think of
Israel's policies surrounding Arafat's illness and death?  Should
President Bush or a senior US official have attended Arafat's funeral?
Should Israel have let Arafat be buried in Jerusalem?

Uh,  Hi, yeah, this is James.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
Hey, James.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
How you doing?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
Good.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
Well,  what do you think?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
I think I was on this one yesterday, same subject.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
I, I believe I've talked about this subject once before too.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
Uh,  Well, let's see, my past views were, uh -- illness-wise, ah -- I
don't think -- it helped him, being in the compound.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
Right.  Right.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
But,  You're, you know, you're never going to know if there was any,
ah, clandestine-type operation that -- Aided his, ah -- ah,  illness.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
I think that they, ah,  (( )), I don't think you're ever going to find
out if there was any direct
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
Right.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
tampering
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
Right.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
but I don't, you know, from just the generic point, or general point
of view, it didn't help his illness once he got -- sick -- being in the
compound, closed in like that with the Arabs.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
Right.  Right.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
And that
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
I don't -- I don't know if I think there was something -- you know,
malicious done, because, you know, looking back -- he's been had this
shaking thing going on
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
for quite some time.  And I agree that the surroundings couldn't have
helped.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
Right.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
Yeah, it, it could've only exacerbated, uh,  his situation.  Because
for -- for a good little while now I've noticed, you know, that his lips
would tremble, and
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
and, you know, it's like, um,  uh, almost like he had, uh, what is
that, Parkinson's?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
Uh, something like that, but, uh, I don't know what the exact
conditions were -- in that compound, but they couldn't have been
couldn't have been, ah, conducive to someone of his age -- and of his
health -- and as far as, as, ah, the United States sending a senior ~US
official, I think they should've sent someone -- I don't know how senior
that person had to be.  But, uh,  it could've been a gesture
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
Well they did -- they did send somebody, I thought. Didn't they go
with a senior official, I had
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
to
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
didn't think they were going to ask this question, but I
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
Oh y- yeah, you're right, they did send someone.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
but it wasn't -- like, ah, wasn't Bush, I definitely wouldn't send him,
I don't think you want to have him in that part of the world right
now.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
Right.  No.  No.  No, I don't think
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
Regardless of what you think about him, he's, ah
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
Yeah, I don't think he should have went -- as a matter of fact, I don't
think any senior official should've went, I don't think -- Secretary of
State Colin Powell should have went.  Uh, whoever they sent was, was
good enough.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
Yeah, was good enough, just to show -- the Palestinian people -- that, uh
you know, America does care somewhat -- that you've lost your leader.
But, uh, no,  it would've been -- it would've been a wro- as a matter of
fact, I think sending Bush would have made it worse.  You know.  Uh,
because he's not liked that much by the Palestinian people.  So I, I
don't think sending him would've been -- would've been the right thing
to do.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
No, I agree with that.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
Yeah, I don't think it would've added anything to -- to the situation.
and possibly could've made it worse.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
As to -- his burial
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
ah,  Not anymore, these are all, uh like these are all political
responses
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
Huh.  Right.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
you know, there is no right answer, considering that that is not
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
you know, they're still arguing over -- that land, and is it, ah
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
who owns it and respect, so I mean it's
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
Mhm.  I'd say my overall opinion is that -- this conflict is way past
that time.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
Yeah, well,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
You know, it's been going on for all these many -- what,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
Hundreds.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
hundreds of years -- and a lot of people have lost their lives, and and
a lot of kids have grown up and all they've ever known -- on both sides
Israeli and Palestinian, all they've ever known is war.  And it's just
tiresome.  I mean, that's, that's my, my view, this thing has gone so
long -- like you said, about a piece of land.  And it's just, you know,
They, they, they got to learn at some point -- that they're going to
have to be able to get along.  Or this is just going to keep going
around, and around, and around,  and, you know, the the -- the
Palestinians will, will, will -- will -- will do something, then Israel
will respond, and then back and forth -- and it's just like a never
ending circle.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
Oh yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
It's like a never ending circle of violence and death and destruction.
And, like I said, I'm personally just tired of it.  I think the world
is just tired of it.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
Oh yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> James </SPEAKER>
You know.  And they need to try and, try and, I, I mean, I don't have
the answer.  You know, I don't have all the answers.  I just know that
it is just -- just an ongoing situation that is- there seems to be -- no
end in sight.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ed </SPEAKER>
I agree.
