I was hoping for another incredibly drawn-out story, full of
antitrust drama, lurking potential bidders, and contentious
confrontations between executives. And then MCI just sort of accepted a
Verizon deal without really bothering anybody . Clearly, their corporate
culture has suffered -- 25 years ago, MCI was the brawling upstart in
the telecom industry, constantly challenging AT&amp;T's right to exist,
much less to monopolize the phone system. And now, they're swallowed by
Just Another Monolith. I expected better -- meaner and tougher, sure,
but better nonetheless.
