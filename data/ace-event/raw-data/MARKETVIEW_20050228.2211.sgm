You'd think he was busy enough with Blockbuster and Hollywood , but
Carl Icahn is once again going after Mylan labs . I'd love to call it a
classic raid -- he's making an offer for the company, nominating his own
board, claiming management can accept one or the other or both, and
hinting that if they paid him enough, he'd probably go away. But the
whole point of raiding is to outsmart an opponent, and that means the
strategy changes constantly. In this case, the most interesting twist is
that he's shorting shares of Mylan's acquisition target, King
Pharmaceuticals; he's basically doubling down on the bet that they won't
acquire. Not only that, but if Mylan bought him out, they'd have less
money to fund a purchase of King Pharmaceuticals. Either way, he's
showing a lot of confidence. Given his record, it's warranted.
