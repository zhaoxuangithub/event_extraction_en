    -Yasser Arafat Murdered?

    -The CIA has classified technology that can target people through walls. A
    -person can be harassed, tortured, slowly killed, or assassinated through the
    -walls of a house, building, or compound.

    -The US government now has the high-tech capability to slowly kill any
    -individual it considers a threat. This high-tech method of murder can't be
    -proven and the person murdered will appear to have died of a cancer related
    -death.

    -The CIA uses through-wall imaging technology for surveillance and targeting
    -of
    -people in houses and buildings. It basically gives the CIA X-ray vision. A
    -targeted individual can be positively identified and targeted through walls.
    -Once identified, the person can be attacked with non-lethal or lethal
    -directed
    -energy weapons.

    -A targeted individual confined to a room, cell, building, or compound can be
    -targeted and dosed with low levels of radiation on a daily basis. This
    -directed
    -lethal energy weapon directs a confined beam of low level radiation in one
    -direction towards the targeted individual. A single person can be isolated
    -and
    -given a slow high-tech death.

    -Through-wall imaging technology combined with directed energy lethal weapons
    -allows the CIA to carry out high-tech assassinations covertly. The CIA has
    -tested this technology on innocent US citizens. For more information, please
    -access the website listed below.

There has always been that urban legend that the Israeli secret police murdered
the Shah of Iran by infecting him with plutonium, which manifested itself into
terminal lung cancer.

I don't doubt that this method has been used to remove various thorns
over the years, but why on earth would Israel have wanted to get rid
of the Shah? b

I don't mean to suggest that I agree with anything David Frum says,
but these Arafat-had-AIDS allegations remind me of what happened with
the late Israeli singer Ofra Haza, where there was a lot of
speculation, a mysterious death from a "blood disease," and then it
came out eventually that she'd died of AIDS. (Although I would think
the Israeli media, who were blamed for hushing up Haza's cause of
death, would take a unique pleasure in making the most of Arafat's, if
all this was true.)

No, they don't. The "suspicious evidence" is simply that
Arafat did not look particularly near death when he was
removed from his HQ. He appeared alert and functioning,
certainly not a week away from death from wasting.

Who really benefits from his death? Surely not the
Israelis, who had him trapped and functioning as a convenient
target for blame. Are Kissinger Associates trying to start a
"Palestinian Civil War" like their Lebanese one a generation
ago? It's hardly a similar situation.
