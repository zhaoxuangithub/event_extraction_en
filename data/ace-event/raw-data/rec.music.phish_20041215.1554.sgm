<SUBJECT> Bush has no shame (NPC) </SUBJECT>

I really couldn't believe what I was watching while Bush put medals on
Talent, Franks and Bremer. Talent was in charge of the CIA when two of
the most costly intelligence failures in American history happened --
not recognizing the Sept. 11 plot, and wrongly claiming that Saddam had
a stockpile of WMDs. Even people who mindlessly defend Bush's
policies, like wjb67, don't want to take responsibility for Talent --
they point out that he was originally appointed by Clinton. Franks was
in charge of the operation that was supposed to quickly go in, take
over Iraq, and then start moving our troops out rapidly -- at this
point I think we're going to see our troops over there at least through
the end of the decade. And Bremer decided to destroy the existing
Iraqi army, leaving it up to us and new recruits to try to impose
order.

This is just one more of those wierd, through-the-looking-glass moments
when Bush is trying to make something that at the very least has to be
seen as troubling, and that I consider an unmitigated failure, into a
success.

Troubling indeed....I will say go a little easier on Franks-not that he
deserves a medal- than the other two idiots though. He was not given
very much to work with--Cheney and Rummy are the ones to blame for the
screwed up war plans-of course I am sure they will get their medals
too. Bush is one of those guys that just sees how he wants to see, and
that is a terrible trait for a leader to have---rose-colored something
something I beleive it's called. Now THIS is an argument against Bush
I can throw my arms around!

His name is Georege TENET.

If you're going to spread your hatred about someone, spell their name right.

Good thing Bush is easy to spell......
