Well, I have yet to hear that scientists from any other country even made
the attempt the American scientists made.

Perhaps the Indonesian government should have taken steps to set up a
hotline of sorts that could be used in case of such emergencies. As the
article notes, the American scientists did not know who to contact. That's
hardly their problem, let alone their fault.

And you pick up the phone in the embassy. A voice on the other end of the
line says he's a scientist with NOAA and that a tsunami is bearing down on
your coastal villages and resorts. Thousands could die. How would you
react to such a call?

I thought so.

All the more reason that the Indonesian government should have taken steps
to set up a hotline of sorts that could be used in case of such emergencies.

The Boston Globe points out that New England has no system in place to
warn residents of tidal waves, which are known to happen off New
England. Sediment slumps on the continental slope could trigger a
tsunamai affecting Newfoundland to Georgia.

The entire East Coast of the U.S. does not have a tsunami warning system.

On the other hand, if you were a scientist at NOAA and were into saving
people from tsunamis, you would think you might have figured out
beforehand who you might call if you did get some advanced warning of
such an event. Also, the Indonesian government probably had no idea that
NOAA could give them advanced warning of tsunamis so how could they know
they should set up a hotline.

So it cuts both ways, the Indonesian government should have done some
prior planning, but so too should the NOAA scientists. You can bet they
are figuring out who they should have call next time.

It's not the responsibility of NOAA to set up hotlines to governments around
the world. The Indonesian government should have contacted the U.S. State
Department and provided U.S. officials with the contact info.

Do you think they warned the USAF boys in Diego Garcia? It's highest point
is only 20' above sea level. If the seabed slopes upward near it, one
might expect nothing remains of the base and its personnel.

FWIK the Indian ocean was not considered a tsunami prone area. Hopefully
we will learn something from this and put some reasonable warning
systems in place.

We just learned that our friend's daughter when to Thailand to visit her
father after the wave hit. There has been no contact with her since she
left.
