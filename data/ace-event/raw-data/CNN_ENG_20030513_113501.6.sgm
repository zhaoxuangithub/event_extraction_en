reporter: the revelations about kennedy's alleged affair
with an intern make up just a couple lines in historian
robert dowd's 700-plus page biography. the information
comes from a single source, an interview with a former
kennedy staffer who says she does not remember the intern's
last game. although he finds the reports of kennedy's
womanizing credible, he believes new information about
kennedy's health problems is more significant. jfk's public
image was one of youthful vigor but in truth he battled
serious medical problems his entire life. twice before
becoming president he was so sick, a priest was brought in
to give him last rites. while researching his new book on
jfk, dallic uncovered previously sealed medical records
that detailed the ek tent of his medical troubles and the
lengths he went to conceal them from the public. there are
many stories about politicians who used political influence
to get out of military conflict. but dallic shows he youed
his family's influence to get into the navy just as america
was on the verge of world war ii. in 1941, he flunked two
military medical exams. his powerful father intervened,
getting yet another exam. reading the report of his exam,
one would think he never had a serious physical problem in
his life. it was a complete whitewash that would never have
been possible without his father's help. kennedy entered
the navy earning hero status for saving his ship mates when
his boat pt-109 was sunk by the japanese. dallek says
kennedy's brushes with death, combined with his t deaths of
his sister and brother, fueled the ambition to led him to
become the youngest person elected president in american
history. kennedy told a friend before he entered politics,
you've got to live every day like it's your last day on
earth. that's what i'm doing. jonathan karl, cnn,
