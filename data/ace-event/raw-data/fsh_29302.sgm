<SPEAKER> Hillary </SPEAKER>
It's uh
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Kelly </SPEAKER>
So the
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Hillary </SPEAKER>
a pretty -- depressing topic for today.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Kelly </SPEAKER>
yeah, I guess so. The truth is I don't really, uh, I don't really know
much about that topic.  I didn't really follow the trial very closely
at all
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Hillary </SPEAKER>
we don't have, uh, cable so we purposely didn't watch the trial, but I
read about it on the internet.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Kelly </SPEAKER>
so
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Hillary </SPEAKER>
and basically
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Kelly </SPEAKER>
Oh, really?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Hillary </SPEAKER>
he -- killed his wife when she was -- eight months pregnant and -- and
dumped her in, uh -- the ocean, basically.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Kelly </SPEAKER>
So why was it so special? Why did that, uh -- particular case make -- the
the national news?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Hillary </SPEAKER>
I think it's because it was in such, it was like a, um
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Kelly </SPEAKER>
Like
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Hillary </SPEAKER>
it was -- in such a quiet, upscale community where it happened and -- um
just I think the fact of her being eight months pregnant, um, drew a
lot of attention and
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Kelly </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Hillary </SPEAKER>
of course people were worried about her for a long time and then they
found her and blah blah blah. It was -- gossip, basically.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Kelly </SPEAKER>
((Yeah, right.)) Oh, but the mistress had nothing to do with the
murder?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Hillary </SPEAKER>
I think -- yeah, cause he found out, they found out he had a mistress,
and then it was like, oh -- Yeah.  Are -- I don't think, I don't think so,
but who knows? I don't know.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Kelly </SPEAKER>
Right.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Hillary </SPEAKER>
very sad cause she has a child herself and so she drug her son through
a lot of -- uh, drama that he didn't need to be part of.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Kelly </SPEAKER>
Wait, what happened?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Hillary </SPEAKER>
I don't know.  She has a son too, so he he also got put -- um -- you know,
in the spotlight a bit, from what I understand. I didn't, I don't have
TV though, so I don't really know.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Kelly </SPEAKER>
Oh, the son of the, right right.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Hillary </SPEAKER>
of -- of his girlfriend, yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Kelly </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Hillary </SPEAKER>
I don't know. I hear though, that he's going to be -- the first person
to be (()) um -- uh -- killed for a crime in California in like, thirty
five years or something.  Oh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Kelly </SPEAKER>
Oh, really?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Hillary </SPEAKER>
I don't know if they've, I don't know if they've -- um -- given him the
death penalty yet. But I think he would be the first in, in a really
long time to actually -- be killed.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Kelly </SPEAKER>
Yeah, that's amazing.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Hillary </SPEAKER>
I don't
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Kelly </SPEAKER>
Um -- why, uh, now why did they decide that this was to be this big (())
out of this with the most heinous crime in all of California?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Hillary </SPEAKER>
well, you know
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Kelly </SPEAKER>
I mean I guess that's not how they decide who died, but it's because
of the
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Hillary </SPEAKER>
you know, and
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Kelly </SPEAKER>
the, uh, cou-, like the -- the court that they went to, like the area
doesn't
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Hillary </SPEAKER>
well, I don't know why they decided on this, I think it was because it
was so public of a case.  But they have a lot of
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Kelly </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Hillary </SPEAKER>
they have many many worse crimes going on in California, parents
killing their children and everything, that you would think -- would
would, um -- you know, be
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Kelly </SPEAKER>
Hearing more.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Hillary </SPEAKER>
be more
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Kelly </SPEAKER>
Stringent penalties,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Hillary </SPEAKER>
yeah, but they don't, they ignore those because this one got on
television, I guess.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Kelly </SPEAKER>
keep like -- uh, the jury from watching ~TV and the media and stuff.
But I guess now ((it's, uh)) -- pretty much impossible -- to do.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Hillary </SPEAKER>
I i don't know. I never really got the whole -- watching it on ~TV and
and getting into the whole -- mystery of it because, in the end, the
woman's dead and so is her child and -- and -- there's -- really no way of
changing that I guess.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Kelly </SPEAKER>
Yeah, uh, I think it's kind of strange how it was so publicized.  Like
I'm just, seriously, like I don't, like I try not to watch, like -- too
much, like
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Hillary </SPEAKER>
You can't help it sometimes.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Kelly </SPEAKER>
Yeah I know.  But it just amazes me that, uh, I think it's ridiculous
how publicized -- how much publicity it got because -- I mean there's like
human rights violations going on all around the world. I mean there's
like, genocide in Sudan right now but like, nobody talks about that.
That's like (())
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Hillary </SPEAKER>
Oh yeah and what's going on in, I know and people -- flock, flock to the
store to buy all their -- all their foreign made goods and it's like
what are you -- doing? Obviously they don't really care about what's
going on. They just like to hear the details.  Maybe if they could
hear the details about other things they would be more involved. I
don't know.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Kelly </SPEAKER>
Um (()) it's almost like, uh -- (()) diversion but it just seems like
they just make it into like, like a soap opera for people to watch,
you know?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Hillary </SPEAKER>
Well you know, some people were glued to their ~TVs for weeks,  and
it's just to disturbing that that would be their -- their main
entertainment during the day.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Kelly </SPEAKER>
Oh yeah, definitely. It's creepy.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Hillary </SPEAKER>
Especially when there's so many other things they could be doing. We
have three kids. I could not sit around all day and watch a murder
trial on ~TV, especially with my kids around.
