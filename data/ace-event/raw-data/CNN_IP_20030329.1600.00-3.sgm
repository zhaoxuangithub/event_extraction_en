<SPEAKER> TUCHMAN </SPEAKER>
This is a very busy base. We want to give you a look right now at the
aircraft coming in for landings. It looks like LAX on a Sunday night and
this is what it's been like for the past 11 days. We have just watched
multitudes of warplanes land, multitudes of warplanes take off and this
may be the busiest night of the campaign. They're expecting a total at
this particular base near the Iraqi border of 300 sorties in a 24-hour
period ending today according to the Air Force total from all the bases
and there are more than 30 bases in 12 different countries in the Middle
East according to the Pentagon. They're saying there will be 1500 sorties
in a 24-hour period ending tomorrow. Eight hundred of those sorties will
be strike sorties using bombs and missiles so there is no slow down in
the amount of air power being used over Iraq. Wolf, back to you.

<SPEAKER> BLITZER </SPEAKER>
That's a lot of bombs and missiles. Gary Tuchman in an air base near the
Iraq border, thanks very much, Gary Tuchman. This programming note,
tomorrow at noon Eastern I'll have a special interview with the nation's
top military officer, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. General
Richard Myers will be my special guest on a special late addition. That's
at noon Eastern, nine A.M. Pacific tomorrow. That's Sunday and I'll be
back Judy and at the top of the hour for Wolf Blitzer Reports. We'll have
a complete wrap of all the day's late breaking developments. In the
meantime, back to Judy Woodruff in Washington.

<SPEAKER> WOODRUFF </SPEAKER>
We'll be watching you both times at the top of the hour and certainly for
late edition on Sunday. Thanks Wolf. Well, as coalition forces push
north, they are encountering a unique problem of combat, getting rid of
the weapons captured from the enemy. Some of the 40,000 British troops
are kicking up a lot of dust in the Iraqi desert making sure that nothing
is left behind them that could hurt them. Greg Milam is with the U.K.
forces in southern Iraq.

<SPEAKER> GREG MILAM, CNN CORRESPONDENT </SPEAKER>
Seemingly deserted, these battered buildings hold a deadly threat to
British forces in Iraq.

<SPEAKER> SERGEANT GEOFF BANHAM, ROYAL ENGINEERS </SPEAKER>
This is what we're coming across a lot of these, 30 mil, 60 mil, 80 mil,
even 120 mil. So there's plenty still out there that will have to be
recovered because they can be used.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> MILAM </SPEAKER>
Do you know when this place was last used? I mean do you know
(UNINTELLIGIBLE)
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> BANHAM </SPEAKER>
I'm not too sure but judging by some of this, it's been here quite a long
time so whether it's been used recently by them - there was an Intel
upbeat saying that they were possibly coming back to try and get this to
use against them.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> MILAM </SPEAKER>
Grenades, mortars, all sorts of ammunition abandoned by Iraqi soldiers
but there for the taking. The job of these Royal Engineers is to clear
this and many other mountains of armaments and destroy them. Some are too
unstable to be moved and have to be blown up on the spot. The rest is
carried way out into the desert. And today's parts in this conflict, this
kind of work becomes more and more important. With the coalition forces
moving forward the last thing they want is weaponry like this lurking
behind them.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> CAPTAIN ANDY GOOCH, ROYAL ENGINEERS </SPEAKER>
With the amounts of ammunition and weapons left about, if they'd used
those systems, that amount of weapon it would have given us a
considerable amount of trouble trying to take the positions.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> MILAM </SPEAKER>
With much of this weaponry there is only one safe thing to do. No one in
the British forces here is willing to take any risks. Greg Milam, Sky
News, Southern Iraq.
