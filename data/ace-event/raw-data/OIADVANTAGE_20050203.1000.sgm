The 2005 Business Blogging Awards are now open for voting. This is a
great place to find a number of interesting sites. I found a number of
blogs that I enjoy among the nominations. I expect I'll be adding to my
blogroll from this list. Little ole Monty's Bluff is in the running for
Best New Business Blog . I'm glad to be in such good company. So take a
few seconds, head on over and cast your vote .
