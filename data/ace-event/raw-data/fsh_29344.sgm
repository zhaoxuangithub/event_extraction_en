5. Death of Arafat (1) Controversial PLO leader Yasser Arafat died in
a Paris hospital last week.  Do you think Arafat's death will help or
hurt the Israeli-Palestinian peace process?  Was Arafat a good leader?
What do you think US policy should be toward Palestine now that Arafat
has died? What, if anything, should the US do to be involved in the
Middle East peace process?

Well, that's good. I w- I want a little.
</TURN>

</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ben </SPEAKER>
Oh, how nice.

Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>

Uh, well, my husband and I. Yeah.

</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ben </SPEAKER>
Yeah.  Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sue </SPEAKER>
Well,  good for you.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ben </SPEAKER>
And we're talking about Arafat here.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sue </SPEAKER>
Yes, Arafat. Let's talk about Arafat. What do you think?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ben </SPEAKER>
Huh.  What do I think?  Um,  well,  when -- around the time he was he
was getting the Nobel Peace Prize and stuff,  I think he got that.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sue </SPEAKER>
Yes, he did.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ben </SPEAKER>
Um,  there was a show here in New York at a big theater. I think maybe
it was at Lincoln Center in the Philharmonic Theater or the
Metropolitan Opera House or the New York State Theater or something.
And Arafat came in and got a standing ovation, you know, a peace prize
winner bah bah bah bah bah.  The mayor of New York, who was then
Rudolph Giuliani,  stood up and walked out, he was also in attendance,
and his, uh, comment to the press afterwards was that, you know, he
just didn't want to honor a terrorist, and I -- one of the few things
that I was happy about with Giuliani when he was mayor.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sue </SPEAKER>
Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ben </SPEAKER>
Uh, Giuliani got very popular later because of the- the
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sue </SPEAKER>
Nine eleven.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ben </SPEAKER>
World Trade Center thing but he- he wasn't so popular as a mayor.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sue </SPEAKER>
Yeah.  Right, I knew that.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ben </SPEAKER>
But, you know, I- I kind of agreed with that Arafat thing, though.  I
-- but I do think he accomplished something in that the Palestinian
people do have a legitimate grievance and he put it on the map, you
know.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sue </SPEAKER>
Well, he- -- he did but I think he really failed miserably,  in my
opinion, when he,  um,  refused to sign that treaty that was
originally set up because it was a wonderful -- option and it really
could've re- done some wonderful things for his people and I think he
really did them a disservice by not taking care of it at that time.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ben </SPEAKER>
Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, what was the treaty? I'm not familiar with it.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sue </SPEAKER>
Well, um, where they were going to, uh, give them, like, ninety-six
percent of the Ga- of- of Gaza and he said that he wanted all hundred
percent.  And so he refused to sign it. It was just an- an incredible
faux pas on his part, from my opinion.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ben </SPEAKER>
Oh.  Yeah. Yeah, y- it's- it's -- you have to sometimes take a little
bit less than you want, you know, uh,  an- and ninety-six percent is a
big percentage, you know.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sue </SPEAKER>
Yes. And I think that could have really done some wonderful uh steps
for -- uh for the Palestinian people uh as a whole.  And I felt -- very
sad that, um, that that wasn't -- done. It really should've been. Um, it
was really quite unfortunate that- that he -- that he was not willing
to,  um, step forward -- to do- do what was really in the best interests
of his people.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ben </SPEAKER>
Sometimes- sometimes I th- I think it's hard when- when you're the-
the first leader, or the George Washington of something, to see things
other than in black and white.  You know, or maybe he didn't have the
gift of- of nuance that would've helped him to- -- to take that right
step, uh, you know, the- -- the -- his people suffer so terribly and
maybe, you know, it could have been better if he had signed that, huh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sue </SPEAKER>
I really think so. I really, truly do and now it's a- a situation
where, with his passing, um, I think there's a real, um, new opening,
a new possibility for- -- some extremely positive steps to come forward
out of this -- I do think that the United States -- will probably be
requested to be involved in the negotiation process and I understand
that, I me- uh, because,  um, I think -- both sides -- have a trust in the
United States that make it-
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ben </SPEAKER>
And we've ha- we have a history, uh, Clinton and Carter w- worked over
there -- -try to get some peace going.  They they they worked very
personally. They had those retreats and things with the leaders,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sue </SPEAKER>
Right.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ben </SPEAKER>
arm-twisting sessions.  And stuff, and uh -- That's why we should be
there but I'm I'm kind of scared of the people -- that represent the
United States now, you know. They're not quite the same caliber.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sue </SPEAKER>
Well, that's really true, um,  but it- it is a -- I mean, we are
having a- a -- step forward in a lot of ways, um. We- we, I think, do
have some potentials, um, to do some extremely positive, um, um,
things.
