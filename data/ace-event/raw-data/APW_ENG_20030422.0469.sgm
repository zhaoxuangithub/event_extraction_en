France proposes suspending U.N. sanctions against Iraq, a step toward
U.S. goal

UNITED NATIONS (AP)

France on Tuesday proposed immediately suspending U.N. sanctions
targeting Iraq civilians, an important step toward the U.S. goal of
ending trade embargoes that have crippled the country's economy.

The surprise move by France, which led opposition to the U.S. war
against Iraq, followed last week's call by U.S. President George W.
Bush for sanctions to be lifted quickly, so Iraq can trade freely and
its oil revenue can be used to finance reconstruction.

France's U.N. ambassador, Jean-Marc de La Sabliere, made the proposal
at a Security Council meeting where members heard a briefing by chief
U.N. weapons inspector Hans Blix and for the first time exchanged
views on potentially divisive postwar issues.

The proposal would end the U.N. ban on trade and investment in Iraq
while leaving a 12-year-old arms embargo in place.

The Security Council imposed sanctions after Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait. Under council resolutions, sanctions cannot be lifted until
U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq's nuclear, chemical and biological
weapons have been destroyed along with the long-range missiles to
deliver them.

Along with France, Russia, Germany and China also strongly opposed
the war. But de La Sabliere said before the meeting that Security
Council ``must take into account the new realities on the ground.''

Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov had said his country is ``not at all
opposed to the lifting of sanctions.'' But he said Russia wants U.N.
inspectors to certify that Iraq has been disarmed of all weapons of
mass destruction, as required under U.N. resolutions.

Asked about the French proposal, he said: ``We are ready to discuss
it.''

At another closed-door council meeting later Tuesday, the council was
to hear from Benon Sevan, head of the U.N. oil-for-food program,
which had been providing food for 60 percent of Iraq's 24 million
people.

France's de La Sabliere said he also proposed that the council phase
out the oil-for-food program, which allowed Iraq to sell unlimited
quantities of oil provided the money went for humanitarian goods and
compensation to victims of the first Gulf War.

``There should be some adjustment with a view of a phasing out of
this program,'' de La Sabliere said.

This is one of the difficult decisions the council will face in the
weeks ahead on divisive issues stemming from the war against Iraq.

These include not only Iraq's disarmament and the future of sanctions
but the U.N. role in Iraq now that the fighting is over, control of
Iraq's oil revenue, and lucrative reconstruction contracts.

Blix stressed that council resolutions call for U.N. inspectors to
have access to all sites and people in Iraq. He said he told the
council that he believes the world would like Iraq's disarmament
confirmed by an international body that has been involved in the
country for over 10 years.

The Bush administration, which accused Blix of hindering its drive
for international support for the war, has already sent its own teams
to Iraq to search for illegal weapons.

``At the moment, the coalition has assumed the responsibilities for
disarming Iraq,'' U.S. Ambassador John Negroponte, said Tuesday when
asked whether U.S. teams would work with U.N. inspectors.

He said important scientists had turned themselves in, and the
atmosphere had changed which should enable any Iraqi ``to speak more
freely and speak without fear of retribution to those who are asking
them the questions.''

France's de La Sabliere said he also proposed that the council ``find
practical and pragmatic arrangements'' to coordinate and combine the
work of the American teams and the work of U.N. inspectors ``so that
the Iraqi disarmament could be internationally verified.''

He told The Associated Press he envisioned sanctions being suspended
``for a couple of months,'' and possibly renewed. He also envisioned
U.S. and U.N. inspectors working together. ``And then sanctions could
be lifted when a legitimate Iraqi government is in place,'' he said.

In an interview with BBC radio aired Tuesday, Blix said that before
the war, the U.S. and Britain appeared to have used ``shaky''
intelligence, including forged documents, in an effort to prove Iraq
had banned weapons.

Blix said it was ``very, very disturbing'' that U.S. intelligence
failed to identify as fakes documents suggesting Iraq tried to buy
uranium from the West African nation of Niger. He told reporters at
the United Nations on Tuesday that the contract about ``yellow cake''
uranium ``was more than shaky, it was a fake.''

U.N. inspectors went back to Iraq for the first time in four years in
late November and discovered no weapons of mass destruction during 3{
months of searching. Secretary-General Kofi Annan ordered all U.N.
international staff, including the inspectors, to leave Iraq just
before the war began on March 20. He has said he expects them to
return.

Annan also said Tuesday in Austria that Iraqis should be in charge of
their own future and natural resources. He acknowledged that ``the
U.N. is being challenged'' but said he expected an agreement on the
U.N. role in Iraq in the ``not too distant future.''
