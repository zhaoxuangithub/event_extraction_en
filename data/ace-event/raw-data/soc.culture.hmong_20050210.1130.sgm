its all politics - north korea got J and A in its hand. the usa got a
pair of Ks. The flop on the table is Q, A, 10,....

the turn might be a Jack for the USA
the river might be a Ace for North Korea.

been cookin about. bush got what he's asking for. karl rove got what he
wish. the democrates are a bunch of cowards. and the hmong well i dont

Jim,

to me it doesn't matter, because the Hmong could not level themselves
evenly.

Jim,

The Hmong will not be sitting and watching from the sideline. America
has positioned its pieces on the chess board of global domination very
carefully. Here are the options:

1. The US will use Hmong American sentiments against LPDR as the
starting point for a regime change in Laos. However, Laos is not the
goal; checkmate is the fall of China, and economic control of China.
The US will support one or two Hmong individuals to speak out against
LPDR human rights violation and Chao Fa resistance fighters. With a
precedant set in Iraq for preemptive attacks, Laos will be taken
overnight and become a source of invaluable logistics for U.S. military
attacks on China.

2. The US's policy of handing out NTR will have the desired effect of
reeling in alliances from the surrounding countries of China. Laos
already has NTR. We shall wait and see if Chinese fat or American fat
taste better to LPDR. If LPDR plays ball with Uncle Sam, then there
will be no bloodshed in Laos. When the Americans get into Laos, the
artificial cooperation will be sufficient for some strategic political
changes. Some Hmong Americans may be reintroduced to Laos. Some Hmong
in Laos, namely, Chao Fa, will be a good source of intelligence on
Lao-China border activities. This will be Chao Fa's chance to replace
their diet of tree roots with rice and fish. Again, America has LPDR
under its control, and America can launch airstrikes and ground units
from Laos.

3. Regardless of what happens, the U.S. has a direct ethnic connection
to China by way of Hmong, which will secure CIA-insurgency operations.
Unlike the current situation in the Middle-East, where the number of
Arabic-speaking CIA agents are few, there will be plenty of
Hmong/Chinese-speaking CIA agents for disposal and use in the looming
Sino-US war. Perhaps by route of Thailand, if LPDR does not cooperate,
the US will incite insurrection in the southern provinces of China.
These provinces have a lot of Hmong people, and have been known to be
the fiercest opposition to Chinese rule (aka Remember the Miao
Rebellions?). This will be the Hmong's God-given chance to fight for
their own country. Let's see if they (and we) agree to a coaltion
government like the Kurds in Iraq.

Those are just 3 options. They all involve Hmong people. Read between
the lines, the war will not be between the US and North Korea. China is
using North Korea to escalate Sino-US relations and test Uncle Sam's
temper.

I sure hope I am not sitting and watching when this all goes down. This
is the perfect opportunity.

As Hmong people say, "Water runs strongly, engine sounds good."
