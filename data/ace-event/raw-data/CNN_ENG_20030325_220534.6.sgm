on we go in the meantime. again, today, there were
disturbing hints, and we underscore hints here, that
coalition forces may soon face an attack using chemical
weapons. yesterday the story centered on intelligence
regarding enemy intentions. today the evidence is somewhat
more tangible. reporting for us, cnn's david ensor.

reporter: the evidence is accumulating that iraq may be
planning to use chemical weapons. gas masks turning up in
abandoned trenches. in nasiriyah in a building marked as a
hospital u.s. marines found weapons, atropine antidote
kits, and that was not all.

<TURN>
they found over 3,000 chemical suits and gas masks as well
as a number of iraqi military uniforms.

reporter: the findings are heightening concerns among
coalition forces approaching baghdad since, as the iraqis
should know, u.s. and british forces do not use chemical
weapons. u.s. officials say some intelligence indicates a

translator: when they started to talk about the weapons of
mass destruction, we know and we always knew that that was
fabrication and lines.

reporter: experts say saddam hussein's forces will likely
try to hold out in baghdad for as long as possible without
using the weapons his government insists it does not have,
hoping to build international pressure on the u.s. and
britain to back down.
</TURN>
<TURN>
in that sense any use of chemical weapons would be
counterproductive to saddam, because it would only
galvanize international
