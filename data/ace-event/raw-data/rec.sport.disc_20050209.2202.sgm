<SUBJECT> Club Sports policies at schools; specifically travel restrictions </SUBJECT>

Hello everyone -

I am attempting to learn more information about the policies of various
athletic departments at schools, specifically with regards to ultimate
teams. At Northwestern, the Men's Ultimate team falls under the Club
Sports department which falls into a dark, barely lit corner of the
Athletic Department. There are some restrictions on what we can and
cannot do. The one that I am most interested in comparing to similar
policies at other schools concerns our ability to travel.

At Northwestern, we are allowed to either rent school vans for no
charge or take our own vehicles to tournaments within 300 miles of
Evanston, IL. Also, we are allowed to fly, take a bus, or take Amtrak
to any tournament we want, no matter how far away it is. We are
allowed to compete under the Northwestern name if we take any of these
options.

However, it often occurs that we want to go to a tournament farther
than 300 miles without flying. (For example, Regionals is often
slightly farther than 300 miles, yet a reasonable drive.) If we choose
to do so, it is understood that we are not officially competing under
the Northwestern name - we are just a group of people playing ultimate
at a tournament and not involving the university in any way.

Do any of you other college players face similar restrictions in your
travel? What are your schools' policies? I am interested in both the
responses of players at public and private schools. Feel free to email
me if you do want to post to the forum.

Thanks for your help.

Man...you guys have it so sweet. Pitt gets $2000/year towards
competition. That means bids, hotel, transportation, jerseys (I do
have to mention, our jerseys this year are hot). That doesnt go very
far, and thats a hard cap on anything related to competition for all
competetive club sports teams. Next year we will be budgeting our
jerseys as "practice jerseys" however, so we hope they'll be paid for.
The point is, $2k gets us to about a tournament and a half using
University transportation.

I dont know about playing officially under the university's name, or
why that matters really. As long as the registrar signs off on the
roster for the UPA, doesnt the importance of University affiliation
become moot?

I should clarify that NU does not specifically pay for us to fly - we
get a budget as well. We pay for our flights/rental cars out of
pocket.

I am specifically interested in the "driving radius", as we call it.
What is your school's? It matters for liability questions.

At SUNY Albany in NY, about as state school as you can get, we get
about 500 less than what you're talking about at Pitt. Our school
doesn't really care what we do at tournaments or how far away we are.
We take our own cars to every tournament, even ones down in Maryland.
The money we get from our student association has to pay for jerseys,
is supposed to help us with tournaments, etc. Every tournament our
team goes to, we each pay 10-20 bucks out of pocket.

If you are an ultimate frisbee team and sleeping in hotels... consider
yourself as spoiled as an ultimate team gets in my opinion. You gotta
learn how to save money. Most tournaments will house you if you ask
and explain your situation. If we can't get housing, we camp out
somewhere. At Binghamton this year we threw up a tent on the high jump
mat (which I must say is very comfortable). Regionals 2 years ago, our
team and about 7 others couldn't afford housing at Princeton so we
camped way way out back on the fields and hung out all night.

For you northwestern guys, you really need to get in touch with someone
at your school that will listen. Our school didn't like us for a long
time, but we behaved ourselves, and very respectfully approached
various people, working our way up the ladder, about changing some
policies. Start off low, and work your way up. Explain to them that
if you are driving your own cars, you should be able to go wherever you
want, and even throw in there if for any reason you bring shame to the
university, you will go right back to the old policy no questions
asked. How often do you go to a tournament and whatever happens there
gets back to administration? pretty much never so your safe with that
offer.

Another thing we did was have a lot of fundraisers on campus, entered
banner contests for sporting events, etc. Once the school saw that
unlike a lot of clubs, we were busting our asses to fundraise and get
involved with school activities, their whole attitude towards us
changed. Sell discs, sell pint glasses, then go to someone, more than
one person, and show them what kind of effort you are putting in. A
lot of school officials don't understand how structured ultimate
actually is. Go in and explain to them about Regionals not just being
some little "get together" but actually be a championship series.

Hope my rambling gave you some ideas that might work
