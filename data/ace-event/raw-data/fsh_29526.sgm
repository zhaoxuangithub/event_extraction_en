<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Hello, it's Marco from Illinois.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Derek </SPEAKER>
Hello, this is Derek from Austin, Texas.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Oh.  Dan, did you say?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Derek </SPEAKER>
Derek.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Derek.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Derek </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Hi, nice to meet you.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Derek </SPEAKER>
Yeah, you too.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Um
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Derek </SPEAKER>
How's it going?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Good, good.  So, uh the election, um -- the, um -- let's see, overall I
felt -- ju- just give you a brief -- summary, I felt -- that -- John Kerry and
Edwards were were pretty strong candidates and -- uh -- mm, I don't know,
I guess just in terms of policy I didn't -- I didn't, uh, find -- that as
compelling as just -- the personality of -- the different candidates.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Derek </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
felt like I could trust Kerry -- uh, little bit more even though he was
much more of a politician than Bush.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Derek </SPEAKER>
Mhm.  Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Uh, he was -- kind of a smooth talker and
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Derek </SPEAKER>
Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Um -- uh -- seems like a politician, they way he presented
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Derek </SPEAKER>
Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
his you know his his um argument.  But -- uh -- strangely I felt like that
what, that was -- one of -- one of his good qualities because I didn't
feel Bush was politician enough.  That um -- one of the -- issues that I
was concerned about was just -- the representation of the United States
and -- on the international stage
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Derek </SPEAKER>
Sure.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
and I just -- uh -- I uh -- I don't know, uh, Bush is -- the way he presents
um -- the ~US position -- uh -- seemed a little -- abrasive to me.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Derek </SPEAKER>
Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
And I -- felt like, hm -- if we're trying to, um -- make -- um -- the United
States safer and more stable -- conflict in the world more stable then
we probably need somebody -- who is a little bit more -- of a politician
in the sense that -- the, they care about diplomacy and -- uh, even though
we may not -- give in to -- the will of the other nations present it in a
nicer way.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Derek </SPEAKER>
Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Yeah, it seems ((I make)) kind of simplistic, but -- that was -- an
important thing for me.  Uh
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Derek </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Derek </SPEAKER>
Um -- I was a little different. I I I agree with everything you said.  I
just, um -- I come from a little different background as far as being -- I
was never into politics and now I I actually have gotten into God much
more and and, you know, searching spirituality out.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Uh huh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Derek </SPEAKER>
Generally people like that are conservative, you know,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Derek </SPEAKER>
uh, with their views because of different things like abortion and,
and, uh, pro-life and -- all that kind of thing so I came form that
background
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Uh huh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Derek </SPEAKER>
eh, but that was just an added bonus for me in the fact that -- I too
was obviously at this point in time concerned about the welfare of our
security -- and I felt personally that if -- Kerry was in office we'd kind
of be, uh -- up a creek without a paddle because I think -- he is so laid
back -- um, and not as aggressive as Bush that at this point in the
game, where we're at -- we're in this thing full full -- steam ahead
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Uh huh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Derek </SPEAKER>
and for a transition to occur at this point -- to someone who is laid
back -- and not as aggressive as him I think would actually endanger the
~US even more.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Derek </SPEAKER>
I think that the international, uh uh, leaders would look at Kerry and
know, they're very smart, I mean they're -- they're on top of these
things, they know, you know, it would , it just would have opened a
gateway.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Uh huh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Derek </SPEAKER>
I feel
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Derek </SPEAKER>
that, uh, it may have actually put us in more danger. At least Bush
has -- pulled out the gun, you know, stick to them, and um -- you know,
that's where I was coming from on that.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Derek </SPEAKER>
And then when I
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
((Do you think))
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Derek </SPEAKER>
I listen to a lot of talk radio and when I heard the stuff about Kerry
back in the -- the the, apparently the scandals he's pulled as far as
the uh, medals when he served time.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Uh huh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Derek </SPEAKER>
You know, uh -- I listen to a lot of talk radio and spoke with, you
know, heard from a lot of, uh -- veterans -- and they said it was
physically, uh, impossible for him to achieve what he said he did.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Uh huh.  Uh huh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Derek </SPEAKER>
And all the meetings he's missing, and just, you know, I think it's
more of a status quo for him.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Derek </SPEAKER>
I think he's more, he got so much money that I think he was just
concerned with attaining this position and a title.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Derek </SPEAKER>
you know ((flag)) for him, so
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Do you think, um -- the -- when the Republicans are campaigning -- they were
saying that well, another attack on the U.S. is -- imminent, that it
probably -- probably going to happen -- and -- um -- and -- they even went so
far to say that if -- it's really difficult to prevent something like
this and of course they're doing the best they can and -- I think Kerry
would do the best he could.  But do you think, um -- that -- and this
isn't quite a political issue, but do you think that -- there's going to
be another attack on the ~US?  Uh like in the next five years?
Something big like -- the world (())
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Derek </SPEAKER>
I, I don't know what your beliefs are, as far as, uh -- biblically or
spiritually or whatever, but -- I believe it's inevitable. I mean, we're
going down, you know? And, yeah, and this is, all these things have
been written about actually.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Really?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Derek </SPEAKER>
Um -- The tw- the uh -- what is it, the towers, uh -- that was actually uh
there's references to that in the bible.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Marco </SPEAKER>
Yeah, I've heard, I've heard about that.
