<SUBJECT> Need Active Angel Investor for guaranteed capital deal </SUBJECT>

I am the head of a company that raised an angel round of
financing from a San Francisco angel investor who I never
physically met initially. Without sounding pretentious, he read
my business plan and on the strength of it, wired me money a
few weeks later

I am currently reviewing investor interest for a guaranteed
motion picture capital fund (YES INVESTMENT IS 100%
PROTECTED AND SECURED IN THE EVENT FILMS DO NOT PERFOM
USING INNOVATIVE FIANCING HEDGE) for the following

I am looking for an active investor/partner for several films
including a Russian "Goodfellas" meets "Once Upon A Time In
America" and several high end studi-esque horror films where the
principal of an investment is secured 100% exclusive of performance.

There is ripe window of opportunity right now for independently
financed film examplified with the recent success of such films
as Napolean Dynamite (made for 250,000, sold for 5 mil, made
50 million at b.o.), Garden State, Open Water, Maria Full of
Grace, Motorcyle Diaries, SAW (made for 750,000-made 60 mil.)
and others.

the CEOS and execs of companies such as Fred Smith of FEDEX,
Norman Waitt Of Gateway, Jeff Skoll of Ebay, Roger Marino of
EMC, Marc Turtletaub of The Money Store, Marc Cuban/Todd
Wagner, and others have all parked their money in film ventures
and deals similar to ours,

I need a similar self made entrepreneur who recently sold his
company; is currently at the helm of one; or, a recently exited
executive with a large severance pay who is sitting in the middle
of nowhere, USA, is bored, and has always secretly wanted to get
into the film business for tax, vanity, or alternative investment
reasons.

While it seems there are other situations that are similar to mine,
i feel that because I do offer a 100% capital guarantee of
principal on investment, my business model and risk
minimization offers more of a clear cut exit strategy than just a
pie in the sky deal.

I am looking for someone who can help me get the financing and is no
frills, reliable, and visionary when it will come down to it.

Someone who has an extensive network in alternative investments, hedge
funds, private equity, and an old-school network. I am not looking for
a boiler room cold caller, but someone that can present my deal to 5-10
guys and make it happen. email to filmhe...@aol.com
