<SUBJECT> Enron &amp; India </SUBJECT>

In India, Bechtel along with General Electric are the new owners of
the notorious and currently defunct Enron power project. The Enron
contract, which legally binds the Government of the State of
Maharashtra to pay Enron a sum of 30 billion dollars, was the largest
contract ever signed in India. Enron was not shy to boast about the
millions of dollars it had spent to "educate" Indian politicians and
bureaucrats. The Enron contract in Maharashtra, which was India's
first 'fast-track' private power project, has come to be known as the
most massive fraud in the country's history. ( Enron was another of the
Republican Party's major campaign contributors). The electricity that
Enron produced was so exorbitant that the government decided it was
cheaper not to buy electricity and pay Enron the mandatory fixed
charges specified in the contract. This means that the government of
one of the poorest countries in the world was paying Enron 220 million
US dollars a year not to produce electricity!

Now that Enron has ceased to exist, Bechtel and GE are suing the
Indian Government for 5.6 billion US dollars. This is not even a
minute fraction of the sum of money that they (or Enron ) actually
invested in the project. Once more, it's a projection of profit they
would have made had the project materialized.

For a slightly different perspective:

"Maharashtra officials say the cost of power supplied by Enron is nearly
double the tariff charged by Indian power producers, and used it as an
excuse to stop paying state debts to the plant. "

"Enron had signed a power purchase agreement with power utility MSEB eight
years ago, under which a $3bn 2,182 Megawatt power plant was to be
commissioned. But the project ran into trouble nearly two years ago with the
Indian authorities beginning to delay payments saying Enron's power tariff
was too high...Though Enron officials refuse to talk about the price they
would be willing to sell their stake at, analysts say the US company is
demanding about one billion dollars for its investments in India. So far it
has only got offers of about half that amount from Indian companies and
financial institutions, but Enron is unwilling to sell its stake at a price
lower than the cost. In case no satisfactory offer comes from the Indian
side, Enron will have little option but to go for international arbitration
as their investments in the country were guaranteed by the Indian
Government. But arbitration proceedings can be a long and messy affair.
Analysts say both India and Enron have little to gain from a protracted
legal battle. The best way out could be a compromise by which Enron gets
less than what it is demanding and more than what the Indians are presently
offering.

IOW: No fraud, just a basic business dispute, in which the party reneging on
its obligations is the gov't of Maharashtra.
The Maharashtra officials are either incompetent fools, or worse- malicious
fraudsters who conned an international comapny into building a
state-of-the-art power plant for them at a cost of billions of dollars, and
then refused payment, knowing the company has no legal recourse except
lengthy international arbitration, and will likely sell the plant to them
for a fraction of its true value.

No; millions of dollars to bribe Indians to sell out India. Has anyone
published the names of these Indians?

Bechtel Corporation?s took control of the water system of Cochabamba,
Bolivia's third-largest city in 2000 under a privatization program
dictated by the IMF as a stipulation for loan payments to the
bankrupt nation.

Within weeks after taking charge of a public company that had even
managed to turn a slight profit, WITHOUT MAKING ANY IMPROVEMENTS
WHATSOEVER IN THE WATER SYSTEM, Bechtel doubled and tripled water
rates, charging the poor of the city $15 or more a month just to keep
their water running... in a city where families live on less than $60
per month.

The poor protested and were subdued by President Gonzalo Sanchez de
Lozada?s security forces. Eventually, after prolonged violent
opposition de Lozada?s plan to sell Bolivia's natural gas exports at
?give-away prices? through multinational middlemen, de Lozada resigned
and fled the country on October 17, 2003. The public subsequently
retook control of Cochabamba's water system.

Bechtel sued Bolivia for loss of potential profits like it is suing
India now - that is, the profits it could have made by continuing to
gouge the poor without investment in capital infrastructure. The
details of the case won't be revealed to the public:

SECRETIVE WORLD BANK TRIBUNAL BANS PUBLIC AND MEDIA PARTICIPATION IN
BECHTEL LAWSUIT OVER ACCESS TO WATER:

Washington, DC- The Bechtel Corporation was handed a powerful victory
last week, when a secretive trade court announced that it would not
allow the public or media to participate in or even witness
proceedings
in which Bechtel is suing the people of Bolivia.
