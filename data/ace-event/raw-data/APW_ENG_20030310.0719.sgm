Report: Hong Kong Jockey Club in talks to acquire its Macau rival

HONG KONG (AP)

The Hong Kong Jockey Club is in talks about buying out the horse
racing club in neighboring Macau, a newspaper reported Tuesday.

The South China Morning Post quoted Hong Kong Jockey Club Chief
Executive Lawrence Wong as saying the discussions were underway, but
no price was reported.

The Hong Kong club is a charitable entity, while the Macau Jockey
Club is a for-profit concern controlled by gambling tycoon Stanley
Ho.

Hong Kong angered Macau's gaming industry last year when it banned
gamblers in Hong Kong from placing horse bets with anyone but the
Hong Kong Jockey Club. Macau had been taking off-track bets from
people in Hong Kong, but the offices handling those wagers were
closed.

The Macau club later threatened to start taking wagers on Hong Kong
races in Macau, at a better price for gamblers because less tax would
be levied, but the plan never materialized.

Neither club immediately returned phone calls from The Associated
Press to inquire about the buyout talks.

Macau is a gambling enclave 60 kilometers (40 miles) west of Hong
Kong that was governed by the Portuguese for more than four centuries
before it returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1999. Hong Kong, a
former British colony, returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
