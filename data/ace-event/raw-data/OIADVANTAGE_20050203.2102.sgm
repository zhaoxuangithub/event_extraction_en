Socially responsible investing. Corporate social responsibility. Just
saying these words seems to elicit some fairly simplistic knee-jerk
reactions. The reaction that I find most amusing is the knowing look of
sympathy. You know, the one that says "Poor naive soul. If only you
understood economics, you would understand the folly of your ways." I do
not intend to get into the stakeholder vs stockholder debate here or
argue the relative merits of Atlas Shrugged . Those discussions, though
interesting, avoid a simpler question. Do measures of corporate social
responsibility contain valuable added information that help investors
pick winning investments?

If all that you have read about this topic is an article in Business
Week or The Wall Street Journal , you've probably heard the standard
answer-- the evidence is mixed. That is true but not very revealing
wouldn't you say? Evidence is mixed mostly because (1) there is little
agreement about how to measure social responsibility and (2) many
current measures toss together a heap of information that has no
business being lumped together. Social responsibility often includes
everything from treatment of employees to type of product produced.
There is not really any reason to believe that selling guns or tobacco
has anything to do with forcing employees to work unpaid overtime. Yet
both get lumped together in the socially responsible investing
discussion.

Once you start to break apart social responsibility into its various
components, you start to see the valuable information. Companies that
have poor employee relations tend to underperform, as do companies that
pollute at a higher rate than their industry peers. On the other hand,
companies with numerous NLRB violations don't do worse than their peers
and companies that sell your typical "sin" products (tobacco, firearms,
gambling) can be excellent investments. Lump all these things together
and of course you will get mixed results. Taken separately, they provide
valuable information about future firm performance.

I guess it is time to get beyond the image of the greedy capitalist
vs. hippie tree hugger in this discussion. Though that would make a
great Celebrity Death Match episode.

Here are abstracts from 16 significant studies about socially
responsible investing and an interesting essay on the subject.
