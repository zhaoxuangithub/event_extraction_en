New explosions rock Baghdad after dark. Witnesses say they heard blasts
around a presidential complex in the center of the city. Meantime, the
U.S. reportedly has hundreds of troops poised to reinforce the Baghdad
international airport, now under the control of American troops. A source
tells CNN's Nic Robertson, some Iraqi Republican Guard forces are
gathering close to the airport. Columns of coalition forces keep pressing
north and tightening the noose on Baghdad. CNN's Central Command says
some 2,500 Republican Guard forces surrendered, that is, between Kut and
Baghdad. Now, the latest on the fight for control of Baghdad's
International Airport. While coalition forces say they have secured the
facility, that's not the case in the surrounding area. ITN reporter James
Mates was with the U.S. forces when they moved in to secure the airport.

It was a showpiece of his regime. Now Saddam International Airport is
controlled by coalition troops and, tonight, it has a new name, Baghdad
International. These pictures were taken on the runway just moments after
the coalition attack. A passenger jet burned out on the tarmac. Wreckage
burning in a hangar as U.S. troops rush in. At dawn this morning, U.S.
tanks and infantry had rolled in to claim their biggest prize of the war
so far. Building by building, they swept the terminal complex, then moved
on to secure the runway. The fall of his airport is a humiliating blow
for Saddam. It lies just 12 miles from Baghdad and will be a key forward
base for U.S. troops as they prepare for a push on the capital. More than
300 Iraqi soldiers have been left dead. Some Republican Guard troops
fought fiercely on the northern side of the airport complex.

Hopefully, this is a sign that we're able to send to the residents of
Baghdad that we're here and they can rise up and deal with the regime
appropriately.

Outside the airport, the fighting was fierce, but the battle unequal.
Here, the remains of an Iraqi armored car, and by its side the body of an
Iraqi soldier, all that remains of a column that pushed up the airport
road last night in a final effort to defend the airport. U.S. troops are
now knocking on the door of Baghdad. But the final push into the city
could yet prove to be the toughest fighting of all. (on camera): The
patchy, somewhat disorganized defense of the airport last night has left
coalition commanders with several questions. Have they done so much
damage now to Iraqi command and control centers that they can no longer
put up a proper fight, or are the best troops simply withdrawing into the
city, to fight there street by street? The answer to that could well
decide how quickly they make a final push into the city. James Mates, ITV
News, with the U.S. marines, south of Baghdad.
