TOKYO, June 25 (AFP)

Major US insurance group AIG is in the final stage of talks to take
over General Electric's Japanese life insurance arm in a deal to
create Japan's sixth largest life insurer, reports said Wednesday.

American International Group Inc. is likely to acquire all shares in
GE Edison Life Insurance by the end of September and also take over
GE's US car and fire insurance operations, the reports said.

The total purchase cost is estimated at 300 billion yen (2.5 billion
dollars), the business daily Nihon Keizai and news agency Jiji Press
said.

GE Edison Life Insurance Co. Ltd. is a key Japanese life insurance
unit of US conglomerate General Electric Co.

No officials at the AIG Tokyo office or GE Edison were immediately
available to comment on the reports.

GE Edison would be AIG's third life insurance unit in Japan following
Alico Japan and AIG Star life Insurance Co.

The acquisition of GE Edison is expected to boost AIG's annual life
insurance premium revenue in Japan to about 1.1 trillion yen, ranking
it sixth in the Japanese life insurance business.
