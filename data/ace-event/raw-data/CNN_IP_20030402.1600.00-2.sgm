That's CNN's Karl Penhaul with the very latest from the battlefront.
Let's get an update now on casualties on Operation Iraqi Freedom.
Military officials say 39 Americans have been killed in combat, 9 more by
friendly fire or an accident. Britain reports 6 of its troops have been
killed by combat, 19 more in nonhostile action and 2 deaths have not been
classified. Iraq does not report on its military casualties, but Iraqi
officials say 420 civilians have been killed and about 4,000 injured.
U.S. Central Command says 4,500 Iraqis have been taken prisoner. Seven
Americans remain prisoners of war in Iraq and 15 Americans are listed as
missing in action. One less than yesterday after that dramatic rescue of
Private First Class Jessica Lynch. Judy, in the next hour, on our special
"WOLF BLITZER REPORTS," I'm going to be speaking live to her older
brother who is in the Army, her younger sister who wants to be in the
Army, just around the same time as Jessica is going to be arriving at
Ramstein, the air base in Germany for some serious medical treatment.
That's all coming up on our special edition of "WOLF BLITZER REPORTS" at
the top of the hour. Judy, back to you.

All right, Wolf, and we will be watching. Thanks very much. Well, at the
Pentagon briefing this afternoon, officials describing several units of
the Republican Guard as effectively no longer being a credible fighting
force. Let's get the very latest from the Pentagon for the overall war
picture as they see it. Our Jamie McIntyre our senior military affairs
correspondent is with us now. Hello, again, Jamie.

Well Judy, the Pentagon is beginning to see positive signs that it hadn't
seen for awhile. First of all, as we saw just a few moments ago on CNN,
the pictures of some of the actual happy Iraqi citizens welcoming U.S.
troops, that taking place in Najaf. Also the Pentagon is seeing lighter
than expected resistance indicating at least that they may have really
seriously degraded those Republican Guard divisions before the U.S.
troops arrived, both in Karbala and also in Al Kut. They met lighter than
expected resistance. But the Pentagon officials stress that as they close
in on Baghdad, this becomes the real dangerous part as they enter that
so- called red zone where Saddam Hussein is believed to have given his
commanders authority to use chemical weapons, and that use of chemical
weapons remains a real fear at the Pentagon.

We are not expecting to drive into Baghdad suddenly and seize it in a
coup de mains, or anything like that. So, in regard to that, we are
paying great attention to their ability to defend on the ground. They may
just suddenly be effective on the ground. Additionally, their ability to
use chemical and biological weapons, they've proven it historically. We
believe they have the capability now. Clearly, as we threaten the core of
the regime, which Baghdad and Tikrit represent, we believe that the
likelihood of them using those weapons goes up.

<SPEAKER> BLITZER </SPEAKER>
In less than 24 hours, the U.S. 101st Airborne Division has driven Iraqi
Fedayeen fighters from the key city of Najaf, pushed north in a
several-pronged attack. The Army's 3rd Infantry has punched through
Karbala, meeting only light resistance from the Medina Republican Guard,
and moving along highway nine within 25 miles of Baghdad. At the same
time, the Marines from the 1st Division have secured a key Tigris River
crossing near Al Kut and reported to have essentially destroyed the
combat fighting ability of that light infantry Baghdad division that was
supposed to be providing defense down there. At the U.S. Central Command
briefing this morning at the forward headquarters in Doha, Qatar, General
Vincent Brooks said that the U.S. would be continuing to approach
Baghdad. He said, quote, "The dagger is clearly pointed at the heart of
the regime now, and it will remain pointed at it," he said, "until the
regime is gone." Judy.

<SPEAKER> WOODRUFF </SPEAKER>
Jamie, these descriptions of the weakening of the Republican Guard begin
to bring back memories of the first Gulf War 12 years ago. Is there a
chance that coalition forces could, at this point, be overestimating the
strength of what's left of the opposition?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> MCINTYRE </SPEAKER>
Well, they might be. And that might be a good thing. They are taking it
very cautiously. No one, again, they stress the most dangerous part of
this could be ahead. Could be urban combat. Could involve chemical
weapons. Could be the most loyal fighters left as they draw into Baghdad.
Could be a very dangerous time. They also are careful to point out that
even while they say that the division has been destroyed, they don't mean
every single person has been killed. Simply that its combat effectiveness
has been eliminated - Judy.

<SPEAKER> WOODRUFF </SPEAKER>
We notice they said they did not want to use the word destroyed, in fact,
they said let others do that. Jamie McIntyre at the Pentagon.
