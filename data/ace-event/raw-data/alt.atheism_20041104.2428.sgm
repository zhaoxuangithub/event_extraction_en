I watched two uncles die of lung cancer (which gave me the impetus to
give up smoking for good), and a close friend die of melanoma. It's
not a death I would wish on my worst enemy.

Consider yourself lucky that you had to wonder about it. I became familiar with
_that_ issue at a very young age. And many times thereafter. To say that it
"hurts like hell" is an understatement, at least the kinds my family had been
prone to. When you see the woman who raised you sucking desperately on a
dropper of liquid morphine like it were her own mother's teat, you're just never
quite the same.

The "woman who raised me" wasn't actually my mother, but my grandmother, btw.

There was the free press in Qatar, al Jeezera but its' offices in
Kabul and Baghdad were bombed by Americans. Only one thing the neocons
hate more than despotism in the middle east and that is freedom of the

The Palestinians want land to live on, while Sharon wants no
Palestinians living on the land. When the world finally
grows the balls to criticize Israeli terrorism, we'll see
peace. But as long as "criticism is anti-semitism" is the
mentality, don't act surprised that the Palestinians object
to the Lebensraum (a/k/a settlements) and Israeli terrorism
(bombings, shooting farmers in their fields, bulldozing crops,
destroying schools, shooting children, etc. etc. etc.).

George Carlin said it best: "Let's not have a double standard,
one standard will do just fine." Apply the same standards to
Israel that we apply to the Palestinians.

I think more likely, one of his palestinian rivals did it. If the
israelis wanted to kill Arafat, I think they'd have better ways.
Unless of course they wanted it to be succinct so they couldn't be
blamed. But one thing that's sure about the palestinians is that no
matter what happens, you can be sure they'll blame it on Israel.

I guess the fact that you live in the US has skewed your view. Bill

May I interpret this as your approving of the Nazi extermination of
