Virginia is apparently going to be build a data center in Richmond, a
back-up data center, and a help desk/call center as a follow-on to the
creation of VITA, the Virginia Information Technology Agency.

The Bristol Herald Courier editorial page is urging that the back-up
center be built in Wise County to take advantage of UVA-Wise . SCHEV, of
course, told the General Assembly that UVA-Wise didn't generate any
economic development, so a new university in Southside wouldn't, either.

The Courier said Wise should get the center over Danville because
there's no Southside university. No other candidate locations were
identified.

I believe that any new state-wide service facilities should be
located in either Southside or Southwest. If we can tie up all state
procurement officials and all vendors in a quest to help
under-represented small, minority, and woman-owned businesses, we should
commit all new state facility spending in a quest to help our
economically disadvantaged regions.

Let's name it after one of our profligate Republican Delegates!

Barnie, have you ever been to the National Conservation and Training
Center near Shepherdstown, WVA? That's the only Byrd pork project I have
ever visited. It is magnificent pork, truly a monument to the art.

He'll have the Washington Monument in West Virginia, if he can just
figure out how to haul it.
