First relief convoy arrives in Iraq as allies struggle to clear the
way

The first sizable relief convoy arrived in Iraq during a sandstorm
Wednesday as allied forces struggled to clear the way for more aid
shipments, using dolphins to remove mines from waterways and hunting
Iraqi fighters around the port of Umm Qasr.

Three days after U.S. President George W. Bush promised ``massive
amounts'' of humanitarian aid, seven large, battered tractor-trailers
arrived in Umm Qasr carrying food and water donated by Kuwaitis. The
convoy was escorted by U.S. soldiers.

``We planned for 30 trucks but we only got seven loaded because of
the severe sandstorm,'' said E.J. Russell of the Humanitarian
Operations Center, a joint U.S.-Kuwaiti agency. The storm cut
visibility to about 100 yards (91 meters).

Hundreds of cases of water were stacked on three of the trucks. The
rest carried boxes of tuna, crackers, sweets and other food.

As the trucks lumbered past blasted buildings on the Iraq-Kuwait
border, an Iraqi boy of about 10 pointed to his mouth and shouted
``Eat, eat!''

People lined up along the streets, giving thumbs-up signs to the aid
convoy as it rolled by and begging for food and cigarettes.

After days of fierce fighting that shut down the city of Umm Qasr,
Iraqi youths cheered and swarmed British troops as they handed out
yellow meal packets and bottles of water Wednesday. The troops,
already in the city, were not part of the aid convoy.

``Umm Qasr is now secure  _  as a port and as a town,'' said Brig.
Jim Dutton of the Royal Marines.

The town's deepwater port, the only one in Iraq, is essential for any
relief effort.

Plans to bring supplies to Iraqi civilians had been on hold for days
because of fighting across southern Iraq. On Tuesday, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan warned U.S. national security adviser
Condoleezza Rice that the United States is legally responsible for
providing relief aid.

White House spokesman Ari Fleischer blamed Saddam Hussein's regime
for slowing the flow of US$105 million in U.S. aid by placing mines
in the port of Umm Qasr.

U.S. Navy helicopters flew two dolphins  _  Makai and Tacoma  _ into
Umm Qasr, where they were to begin ferreting out mines Wednesday.

Royal Marine commandos carried out an overnight sweep around the
port, searching for Iraqi holdouts. The British said they had enough
control over the area to begin sending in ships.

A British ship, the Sir Galahad, moved into position at the mouth of
the Khor Abdallah river Tuesday night with 211 tons of food and 101
tons of bottled water. It was to begin the six-hour journey into Umm
Qasr on Wednesday, according to a pool report.

Iraqis have about five weeks of food left, according to estimates by
the World Food Program. About 13 million people  _  60 percent of
Iraq's 22 million  _  are completely dependent on food handouts,

The World Food Program, a U.N. agency, said it would make its biggest
single request for cash in its history	_  more than US$1 billion to
help feed the war-stricken nation for about six months.

``This could well turn into the largest humanitarian operation in
history,'' said agency spokesman Trevor Rowe.

Before the war, Iraqis depended on government rations distributed
under the U.N.'s oil-for-food program. The 7-year-old program allows
Iraq to sell unlimited quantities of oil to buy food, medicine and
other humanitarian goods. The proceeds from oil sales are deposited
in a U.N.-controlled escrow account.

The war has thrown the future of that program in doubt.

Because the United States and Britain failed to get U.N. backing for
the war, Russia, France, Germany and China want to ensure that the
immediate humanitarian costs of the war are paid by the United States
 _  and not the United Nations.

Annan wants to revive the U.N. aid program as quickly as possible. A
resolution giving him authority to run the program for 45 days is
stalled because Russia, Syria and others are insisting the United
Nations must not sanction the war or give the United States control
over the U.N.-controlled account, which holds billions of dollars.

Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh accused the United States
and Britain of causing the hardships by launching the war and
disrupting shipments of supplies under the oil-for-food program.

He claimed, though, that Iraq can fend for itself: ``Iraq does not
need any humanitarian assistance. We are a rich country.''
