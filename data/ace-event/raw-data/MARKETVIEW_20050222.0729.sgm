Read this report on the U.S.-Russia Technology Symposium . It's a
great summary of the paradoxes of the Russian economy: They have a huge
untapped supply of valuable IT labor, but their IT exports are only a
tenth of their military exports (and only a thirtieth of India's IT
exports). They develop lots of new technology, but nobody can tell who
owns what. And, of course, their securities laws and property rights are
even flimsier than China's -- after the Putin administration mugged
Yukos on the grounds that it was too attractive a target to leave alone,
they lost a lot of trust. Still, they have an unbelieveable amount of
untapped potential.
