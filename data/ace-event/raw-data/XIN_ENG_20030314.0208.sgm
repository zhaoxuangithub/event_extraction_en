BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua)

Most Beijing travel agencies have suspended tourist trips to the
Middle East as tension heightens in the Gulf region, Thursday's
Beijing Youth Daily reports.

Out of security concerns, major travel agencies, including the China
International Travel Service, China Travel Service and China Youth
Tourism Service, have temporarily suspended tours to Egypt and Turkey
for Chinese tourists.

According to Dun Jidong of the China Travel Service, once war breaks
out between the United States and Iraq, not only will Middle East
travel routes be frozen but the entire overseas travel business will
be affected.

The only few travel agencies still organizing visits to the Middle
East have increased their prices by 500 to 600 Yuan (60 to 72 US
dollars). An 8-day visit to Egypt and Turkey, for instance, has
increased to 12,500 Yuan (1,506 US dollars).

According to a staff member with one travel agency still doing Middle
East business, the increases reflect the rise in oil prices and the
increased difficulty in getting visas.

Asked about the possible war, he said, if tours were curtailed
because of a war emergency, the agency would refund the portion of
the costs covering the remainder of the trip.
