Jack Welch seeks details on estranged wife's work in divorce case

BRIDGEPORT, Connecticut (AP)

Retired General Electric Co. Chairman Jack Welch is seeking
work-related documents of his estranged wife in his high-stakes
divorce case.

The Welches disclosed their plans to divorce a year ago, shortly
after Suzy Wetlaufer  _  then editor of the Harvard Business Review 
_ revealed she had become romantically involved with Welch while
working on a story about him.

In court papers filed this week in state Supreme Court in New York,
Welch requested a deposition next month of David Heleniak, a senior
partner in the law firm of Shearman &amp; Sterling in New York. He
also wants to subpoena all documents maintained in Jane Beasley
Welch's personnel file by Shearman &amp; Sterling, a prestigious
corporate law firm where she worked before she married Welch.

Welch specifically is seeking performance evaluations, correspondence
between his estranged wife and partners while she worked at the law
firm's office in London, and documents related to her prospects of
becoming a partner.

Welch also wants details on Jane Beasley Welch's salary, benefits,
retirement plan and other compensation paid to her.

Michael York, one of Jack Welch's attorneys, called the move routine.

A judge ruled in February that depositions in the divorce case will
remain confidential.

Earlier documents in the case have included embarrassing details
about perks Welch received as part of his retirement package from GE
at a time when corporate scandals were sparking outrage.

The court order was requested by Jack Welch's attorney, Daniel K.
Webb, who said Welch would likely be asked about his business
dealings, his health and entries in his personal diary.

Webb also said details of the breakdowns of the Welches' previous
marriages were likely to come up, and cited reports of alleged
extramarital affairs by both.

Welch has previously failed in an attempt to temporarily seal a
financial affidavit. That document detailed monthly outlays of some
$51,000 for upkeep on a half-dozen houses scattered from
Massachusetts to Florida, more than $52,000 for gifts and nearly
$9,000 for food and drink, among other expenses.
