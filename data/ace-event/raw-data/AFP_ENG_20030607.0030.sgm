NEW DELHI, June 7 (AFP)

A provincial chief from India's main opposition Congress party has
told an election rally that India is suffering nature's "curse"
because both the president and prime minister are bachelors, a report
said Saturday.

The Times of India newspaper quoted Digvijay Singh, chief minister of
the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, as saying that Prime
Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and President Abdul Kalam had offended
the Hindu rain God Varuna by remaining bachelors.

"The country is being ruled by a bachelor president and an unmarried
prime minister. This according to the Hindu shastras (books) is very
inauspicious and that is the reason there is a widespread heatwave
and drought," said Singh.

"Not just Prime Minister Vajpayee but President Kalam's bachelor
status is making the country dry, arid and infertile," he added.

The general secretary of Vajpayee's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party,
Pramod Mahajan, retorted that Singh's statement was "beneath
contempt."

India's has been reeling under a heatwave since mid-May which has
killed 1,403 people. The country's western desert state of Rajasthan
is also bracing for its fifth straight year of drought.
