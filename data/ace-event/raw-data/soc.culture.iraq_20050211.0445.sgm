<SUBJECT> Iraq Elections at this point </SUBJECT>

This is getting strange. I actually can't recall it ever taking 2
weeks to "count" these many ballots, generally elections are called
within 24 hours. In this case counting is taking 2 weeks.

What is strange is everyone knows who won, Sistani won. His party, the
major winner, could not field canidates until just before the election,
but it was his face on all the poster and his part wipped up the
heavily funded US supported government.

So we have the voice of the people of Iraq, even if the Sunni's had
voted Sistani would still be the majority leader. But he was not
running. So the US has entered in to the classic Shia quicksand of
Islamic Republics, which have caused it such problems in Iran.

Sistani will run Iraq, or the election will be ignored. The problem
with Sistani running Iraq is he refuses to talk to the Ameircans, and
as the real power broker what ever figure heads take the PM and other
posts will speak with as little authority as their counter parts in
Iran. The US is now fighting a war for a nation who government they
have no direct ties with.

The other option, and what the US seems to be trying, is to somehow
fudge the election so Sistani does not win, that raise doubts about the
outcome, claiming fraud, do anything so that the election causes to
results. Given the American attention span is about 10 minuts the
creation of a dictatorship of US puppets against the election would be
ignored in the US. This would actually be not only in the US best
interest, but might be militarily necessary. I can't imagine how the
US Occupation could operate in a situation where Sistani has the
ultimate power.

In the long run I can't see how Iraq can avoid civil war, since its had
it so many times in the past. Civil War leading to the victory of one
group is the norm in Iraq, and was the casue of most mass graves in the
1980s and 1990s. Likely only sanctions have killed more.

Sistani has the popular support and the claim of the election which the
Ameircans bungled baddly and allowed him to take over. The Sunni's
have the weapons, the skill, and the support. The US occupation is
becoming more difficult by the day and Bush has shown he fails to
understand the situation. Hell when the worst possible event in the
election was happening, Sistani was flooding the polls with his
supporters Bush was crowing. Sadly Bush's concerns are short-term
politics in the South of Ameirca, and they have already decided they
don't have to pay attention to Iraq.

With more and mmore Sunni supporting the insurgents Iran, the big
winner in all of this, will feel the need to back Sistani in the south.
So if the US leaves its possible we could see Iraq carved up between
the groups.

As for a civil war, its already started.

It is pretty bizarre, considering how long they had to organize
elections. It may be that they want the public to get adjusted to the
fact that the Shia's are taking over before announcing official results.
The US is not going to change the results. A shia government will
allow us an exit strategy. All we have won in iraq is maybe a shaky
neutrality. Its not like Germany or Japan where they were so terrified
of the Soviets post war that they were happy to see the US stick around.
I myself would have been happier with a Mushariff military
dictatorship or junta taking over. That is the only way to keep religion
out of running the government. In my opinion, all we have to the average
Iraqi citizen is brought a new type of domination.
Many small businesses will have to close down (alcohol related)
women will have to dress head to toe again, etc.
There is only one ray of hope, that Sistani will prove a very
strong leader and actually care about the moderate muslims in his
country and
protect them. Its a wait and see game
As for the Sunnis, they are probably going to have to be crushed.
