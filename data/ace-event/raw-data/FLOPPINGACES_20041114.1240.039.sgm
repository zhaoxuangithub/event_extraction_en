Time is reporting today that a al-Qaeda operative was captured and is
spitting out that they have plans in the work to smuggle nukes into the
US from Mexico, see the article here . Thank god Bush is still our
president, although I strongly disagree with him on his new immigration
policy. This policy would just make it easier for the enemy to get
within our borders.
