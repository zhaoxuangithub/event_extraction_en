<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
Uh, Baretta.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ken </SPEAKER>
Oh, that's Baretta. He's he's in jail.

Baretta.  Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ken </SPEAKER>
I don't know. These guys, I don't know.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
Robert Blake doesn't seem like he's all there.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ken </SPEAKER>
Yeah, well.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
I I don't know what's going to happen in that one.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ken </SPEAKER>
But he needs that parakeet with him or something.  Remember the
parakeet in the show? Yeah, I
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
That's right.  I forgot about that.  Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ken </SPEAKER>
uh, Gilligan's Island, all this good stuff.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
Right.  ((Right.)) -- Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ken </SPEAKER>
I mean, it was great stuff.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
Baretta.  They -- Baretta had a really good theme song, too.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ken </SPEAKER>
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I like that song. I like that song, yeah. But with
this Peterson guy -- he looks so cool and reserved but, uh, it's like
nothing's phasing him, and
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
I know. Even when they
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ken </SPEAKER>
Do you think he did it?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
when they read the verdict he he didn't even flinch, didn't even
blink.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ken </SPEAKER>
No.  Uh, do you think he did it?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
I went, wow, that's kind of weird.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ken </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
Well, i- it makes me think that he probably did it.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ken </SPEAKER>
Eh, he, eh, w- it seemed like he covered his tracks, though, I mean,
they have no evidence other than the bodies that they found.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ken </SPEAKER>
So, it's crazy, but,  they're saying where they're going to put him th
eh, in the same prison next to Charles Manson or something like that.
That's, like, really crazy.  Yeah, so they can be buddies or
something, I don't know.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
((But))
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ken </SPEAKER>
But I don't think he's going to last in jail if he goes to jail, I
mean. They talking abou- -- how do you feel about this death penalty
thing?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
Well,  jeez, I I don't know.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ken </SPEAKER>
Eh, I mean, I don't thin- I mean, I I I don't think that he should
suffer that, you know, I think he should, um,  I don't think that he
should suffer that.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
Yeah.  Well, if if he does live and he is in prison,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ken </SPEAKER>
Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
he'll probably get some wacky woman -- who wants to marry him,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ken </SPEAKER>
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah, that
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
get married two or three times in there.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ken </SPEAKER>
Yeah, that reminds me of the Central Park, uh, guy Robert Chambers in
New York City. Now,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ken </SPEAKER>
they've -- I'm surprised they haven't made a big, big -- thing out of it,
eh, he just got busted last week for some -- something.  And, um,  I
think he s- m- was meeting women in the jail like that, too, when he
was there, but he just got out of doing fifteen years and,  you know,
he was just, eh, Central Park, he had, uh,  well, rough sex or
something, with a woman in the park and they said he strangled her, or
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
Oh, sure, the preppy guy.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ken </SPEAKER>
Yeah, the preppy guy, yeah.  They caught him last weekend doing
something, but,  uh, he driving without a license or whatever.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Paul </SPEAKER>
Yeah, just always always in trouble now.
