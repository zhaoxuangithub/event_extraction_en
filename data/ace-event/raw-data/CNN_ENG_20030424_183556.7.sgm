some breaking news out of fort worth, texas, tonight. a big
shake-up at american airlines. let's turn to gregg clarkin
who is on the ground in texas with the very latest. good
evening, gregg, what happened?

reporter: good evening, paula. a management blunder we
heard an awful lot about on behalf of donald carty, the ceo
of american airlines, parent company amr has cost carty his
job. the company announcing that donald carty is out as
ceo, he'll be replaced by gerald aftery. carty, if you
recall has been pressuring unions over the last couple of
months to accept steep pay cuts, cutting back their
vacation time and holiday pay, as well, saying the company
needed these concessions at bankruptcy court. no sooner did
the unions agree to these don sessions that it became known
that carty and had some of his top executives had given a
bit of a package of perks. perks that included a trust fund
to protect some of the pensions in the event of a
bankruptcy as well as retention bonuses. when the unions
learned of that they became outraged and said confidence
and trust in carty was damaged without repair. carty is out
as ceo of amr, the parent of american, the world's largest
airline. one other topic still to be decided, bankruptcy.
the company saying if they don't get the flood attendants
to concede to a special offer, they will indeed file for
bankruptcy. back to you.

thank you very much. the chief executive of the world's
largest airline has resigned, not a com plately unexpected
move because several board member his talked about wanting
him to leave. we will move on to other material now as
we've been reporting, nobody seems to know for sure if
saddam hussein is dead or alive. whatever his fate, he left
behind some videos. home videos, in fact. bruce burkhart
has taken a look and he says they show a very different
side of a former iraqi ruler.

reporter: who was that nice man strolling with his wife?
yes, it's him. the cruel and ruthless iraqi dictator,
saddam hussein. all warm, fuzzy. romanticly strolling with
his first wife on a snowy path, trendy leather coat, furry
hat. gently kissing her good-bye like a good husband at the
now famous saddam hussein international airport. tailored
suit, shyly a modest cake for his 50th birthday. happily
chatting with peasants behind the wheel of his white
mercedes. well, this is not an episode of joe dictator, or
an iraqi version of the lifestyles of the rich and famous.
these are videotapes from the '80s found in a palace of
saddam hussein's first wife. bizarre imagency almost
surreal, but a reminder that even brutal dictators have a
private
