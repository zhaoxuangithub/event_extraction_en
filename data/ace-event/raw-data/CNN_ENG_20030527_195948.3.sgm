first an update on a long running air safety investigation a year and
a half near an airline crashed near new york's kennedy airport there
is controversy whether the disaster could have been averted. 265
people died in the november 2001 crash of flight 587. hard to forget
those images. after the pilots lost control of the plane, and the
jet's tail fin broke off. airbus strongly denies claims it failed to
provide sufficient warning. but critics say airbus should have sounded
a stronger alarm after a similar incident occurred in 1997. that is
when american airlines flight 903 ran into trouble on a trip from
boston to miami. the pilots of that plane forcibly applied their
rudder to recover from a stall, and as a result the plane's tail
section exceed its design limits. pilots managed to land safely, only
after a terrifying ordeal for passengers. melanie joyceon joins us
from dallas. thanks for being with us. can you tell me about the
flight five years ago. what happened to you?
