It was in northern Iraq today that an eight artillery round hit the site
occupied by Kurdish fighters near Chamchamal. It happened near an area
abandoned earlier by Iraqi forces. CNN's Kevin Sites is in northern Iraq.

<SPEAKER> KEVIN SITES, CNN CORRESPONDENT </SPEAKER>
This is the road to Kirkuk. A day ago it was controlled by Iraqi troops
and packed with these land mines but now we can drive far enough to see
the outskirts of Kirkuk. That's because coalition fighter jets pummeled
this Iraqi position on the hills above Chamchamal and Iraqi troops made a
hasty retreat. This is what the hilltop looks like now, craters 15 feet
deep, busted bunkers and twisted metal, scattered ammunitions and
tattered clothing, a helmet, a tube of toothpaste. Kurdish Peshmerga
fighters took their place. I'm glad to see them go this one says. They
killed a lot of our people in Chamchamal but I feel bad for them too.
Some of them were only conscripts. Some Kurds took advantage of the Iraqi
retreat right away. This one took a bulldozer to a concrete portrait of
Saddam Hussein. It took about 20 minutes but finally it came toppling
down. He says after finishing the job he hopes Saddam Hussein himself
will fall too but despite the exuberance of Kurds in the area, it's clear
it's much too early to celebrate. Although the Iraqis retreated from this
area, at dusk they fired what observers say were seven artillery rounds
back at their former stronghold creating new fear and potentially new
casualties. Kevin Sites, CNN Chamchamal northern Iraq.

All right and when we return, waiting here on the home front, a very
special reunion between a Marine and his wife. There is no greater gap
probably than that between the troops overseas and their loved ones here
at home. CNN helped bridge that cassum (ph) at least temporarily between
Sergeant Craig Martin of the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit and his wife
Kaycee Martin in California. They talked by videophone this morning.

<SPEAKER> ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR </SPEAKER>
You're eight months pregnant I believe. How has this been for you?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> KAYCEE MARTIN, WIFE OF SOLDIER </SPEAKER>
It's been difficult. It's hard without him. I'm doing OK but it would be
much better if he was home with me.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> COOPER </SPEAKER>
If I could just ask, I mean and you know I don't want to pry so anytime I
ask something you don't want to say just tell me to shut up but what is
it like for you watching all this coverage? I mean watching, you know,
the access. The pictures were seeing are really historic in what we are
able to see. Is it more - does it make it more difficult? Does it make it
easier?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> K. MARTIN </SPEAKER>
It's very difficult. It's hard. The whole time though you're just sitting
there trying to catch a glimpse just to see if maybe one of the people on
TV is him but you know he tells me don't watch, don't watch. You know,
it's going to be difficult but like I said, it's just too hard. I want to
be able to see just to make sure that he's OK, just catch a glimpse of
him.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> COOPER </SPEAKER>
How does he look to you right now?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> K. MARTIN </SPEAKER>
He looks all right, but dirty.

<SPEAKER> SGT. CRAIG MARTIN, 15TH MARINE EXPEDITIONARY UNIT </SPEAKER>
I lost my tooth.

<TURN>
<SPEAKER> K. MARTIN </SPEAKER>
Beautiful. Thanks. Thanks for showing me.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> COOPER </SPEAKER>
How'd you - how'd you lose your tooth?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> C. MARTIN </SPEAKER>
Sorry.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> COOPER </SPEAKER>
Can I ask? How did you lose your tooth?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> C. MARTIN </SPEAKER>
When we came across the bridge, the enemy launched some 155 artillery
rounds at us. It came pretty close and the concussion knocked my tooth
out.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> K. MARTIN </SPEAKER>
Great.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> C. MARTIN </SPEAKER>
Yes.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> K. MARTIN </SPEAKER>
It doesn't sound like you're being too careful.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> C. MARTIN </SPEAKER>
It was fun though. We're all right.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> COOPER </SPEAKER>
Sergeant Martin I don't know if you see, your wife's sort of shaking her
head.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> C. MARTIN </SPEAKER>
Careful as I can be. It's all good.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> COOPER </SPEAKER>
Sergeant Martin, is there anything else ...
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> C. MARTIN </SPEAKER>
I love you.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> COOPER </SPEAKER>
Is there anything else you would like to say either to your wife or to
all the people who are watching this? I know this awkward, you know,
doing this on TV and I hate to put you in this position but feel free.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> C. MARTIN </SPEAKER>
Yeah. I've got a couple of things real quick. To my old man, this is not
a distraction. To my wife, we'll be home soon and I love you. That's all
I've got to say.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> COOPER </SPEAKER>
Well that says a lot. Kaycee, anything else you want to say?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> K. MARTIN </SPEAKER>
I love you very much. I miss you very much. Everyone is praying for you
and I just want you to come home safe and soon so you could see our new
baby.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> C. MARTIN </SPEAKER>
One more thing, you look really beautiful right now.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> K. MARTIN </SPEAKER>
Thanks. I'd like to say the same to you.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> C. MARTIN </SPEAKER>
That's stylish. Don't worry. We'll take it home.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> K. MARTIN </SPEAKER>
Well, just come home soon.

<SPEAKER> WOODRUFF </SPEAKER>
A little embarrassing for us to watch. It's got to be difficult talking
to your loved one in front of thousands and thousands of people on
television, millions. Well, in addition to the baby on the way, the
Martins also have a three-year-old daughter. And that is it for this
hour. I'm Judy Woodruff in Washington. Wolf Blitzer's report starts right
now.
