MACAO, April 16 (Xinhua)

Four Macao residents have been notified by the Health Services that
they shared the same plane with a Taiwanese suspected to have
contracted Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) on April 8.

The Health Services urged the four residents to contact the authority
immediately to report their health condition.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for
suspected cases, these four residents need not to be isolated,
however, they should seek treatment immediately if they have any SARS
symptoms.

In order to improve the epidemic control, Secretary for Social
Affairs and Culture Chui Sai On, who has been named director of the
SARS task force by the government, has designated representatives
from the Health Services and the Center for Disease Prevention and
Control to visit neighboring Guangdong Province on Thursday, to learn
from Guangdong's experience and know-how in combating SARS, which
have been acknowledged by WHO.

No suspected SARS case had been found at medical consultation
counters at Macao's three ports of entry as of Wednesday.

In case that any SARS infection is confirmed, the task force will
quickly take round-the-clock command and make news release every six
hours, Chui said.
