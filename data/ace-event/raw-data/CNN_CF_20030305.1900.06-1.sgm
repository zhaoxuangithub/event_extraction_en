Look at Latest Evidence Against Iraq; Any Hope U.N., Old Europe will 
Come Around to Bush Administration's Way of Thinking?

<SPEAKER> BEGALA </SPEAKER>
Welcome back to CROSSFIRE. Maybe it's just me, but I think Michael
Jackson, he's kooky, wacky. Time now for "Fireback," where our wacky and
kooky fans and friends and critics right in. Don from Denver, Colorado
writes, "Paul, you keep referencing Halliburton selling equipment to
Iraq" -- which I do. "I recall, as reported in 'The Wall Street Journal,'
that the transactions were legal. Is it possible that the equipment
allowed Iraq to produce oil for the Oil for Food program authorized by
the U.N.?" They were legal because Mr. Cheney's company used a loophole.
They went through a foreign subsidiary. But they did enrich Saddam
Hussein and his evil, ruthless regime, and they were immoral. They were
wrong. Dick Cheney should have never profited off of doing business with
Saddam Hussein.

<SPEAKER> CARLSON </SPEAKER>
I would agree with that. What does that have to do with the war in Iraq?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> BEGALA </SPEAKER>
It means Cheney is a hypocrite. He's trying to lead us into a war against
one of his valued customers.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> CARLSON </SPEAKER>
Well it's a complete...

(CROSSTALK)

<SPEAKER> CARLSON </SPEAKER>
You're attacking the man. That's irrelevant to the argument.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> BEGALA </SPEAKER>
I'm attacking his business practices.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> CARLSON </SPEAKER>
No, no, you're attacking -- OK great. That's great. But it has nothing to
do whether we should go to war with Iraq or not.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> BEGALA </SPEAKER>
Well yesterday he was a valued customer, today he's an even villain.
</TURN>

<SPEAKER> CARLSON </SPEAKER>
Right. So we're against Dick Cheney, but that doesn't have anything to do
with Saddam Hussein. Chad Hensley, from Fairfax, Virginia, writes,
"France, Russia and German have all multi-billion dollar oil deals with
Saddam in Iraq. I wonder why they protest the war with Iraq. It must be
the humanitarian reasons." Well, Chad, that's what liberals assume. That
Europe is against the war on humanitarian and moral grounds, but the U.S.
is for the war because it wants to profit for the oil companies. It is a
weird assumption, don't you think?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> BEGALA </SPEAKER>
As you know, I've never said that.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> CARLSON </SPEAKER>
You haven't.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> BEGALA </SPEAKER>
I don't believe for a minute that this is a war for oil. I think it's
unwise, it's unjust, it's unwarranted, but I don't think it's about oil.
Now, the reason that France, Russia and Germany are against war is
because they have democracies. The people are against it. It's called
democracy. Those leaders are reflecting the views of their people.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> CARLSON </SPEAKER>
They hate America, Paul.
