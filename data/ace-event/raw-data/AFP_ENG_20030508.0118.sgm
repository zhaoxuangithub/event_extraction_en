LONDON, May 8 (AFP)

British bank Barclays announced on Thursday it had agreed to buy
Spanish rival Banco Zaragozano for 1.14 billion euros (1.29 billion
dollars) in cash.

"The combination of the banking operations of Barclays Spain and
Zaragozano will bring together two complementary businesses, creating
a nationwide distribution platform, trebling the existing Barclays
branch network and trebling its existing customer base," Barclays
said in a statement.

"The acquisition of Banco Zaragozano builds on our existing business
creating the sixth largest private sector banking group in Spain" by
assets, added Jacobo Gonzalez-Robatto, chief executive of Barclays
Spain.

"It provides a platform for us to intensify and strengthen our
competitive position in the Spanish banking market, to the advantage
of our customers, employees and shareholders."

The members of the board of Zaragozano have voted in favour of the
transaction and have committed to sell their shares to Barclays.

Shareholders, including board members, owning 54 percent of the
ordinary share capital of Zaragozano have given irrevocable
commitments to accept the offer.

The takeover, which is subject to approval by 75.01 percent of
Zaragozano shareholders, is expected to be completed in July.
