Ocalan

ATHENS, Greece (AP)

A retired navy officer facing life in prison over a failed effort to
protect Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, told a court Thursday
he felt remorse for his part in the 1999 plot.

``I have a guilty conscience,'' Andonis Naxakis said during his
two-hour testimony.

Naxakis is one of 13 people on trial for bringing the fugitive
guerrilla leader to Greece. Ocalan was moved by the government to its
embassy compound in Kenya, where he was captured by Turkish
commandos.

The retired Greek officer said he had been trying to get Ocalan to
The Netherlands, home to a large Kurdish community.

He claimed he had been manipulated by the government.

``I believe I was unwittingly used as bait for its disgraceful plan
... an organized move by the government to hand Ocalan over to
Turkey,'' he said.

Naxakis and two of Ocalan's Kurdish associates are being tried on
criminal charges of endangering national security. Ocalan, being
tried in absentia, was indicted for entering the country illegally, a
misdemeanor.

Ocalan, leader of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, is serving a
life sentence in Turkey for leading a 15-year insurgency against the
country that left 37,000 people dead.

He is being tried in Greece in absentia.
