EU rift over Iraq remains as France, Germany denounce U.S. move to
war

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP)

Europe's divide over Iraq loomed ever larger Tuesday with France and
Germany denouncing the U.S. move toward war while British Prime
Minister Tony Blair said ousting Saddam Hussein now was key to
solving similar crises in the future.

As European Union leaders restated their opposing views on Iraq,
their foreign ministers debated the impending U.S.-led war against
Iraq with EU president Greece keeping up appearances with a pledge to
pursue a last ditch effort to avoid war.

Joschka Fischer and Dominique de Villepin, the German and French
foreign ministers, were to attend a special United Nations Security
Council meeting in New York Wednesday, called to issue a last-minute
appeal for a peaceful solution to the Iraq crisis.

''For us the United Natgions is the key authority'' in resolving the
Iraq crisis, Fischer told reporters opn arrival at the EU meeting.

''War is not justified,'' Fishcer told reporters. ''As members of the
United Nations Security Council we want to restate that we want a
peacefiul solution.''

De Villepin made no comment on arrival. Ahead of the EU meeting,
Greek Foreign Minister Georhge Papandreou told reporters, ''We have
to, and we will continue, to search for a peaceful solution to the
crisis.''

The EU meeting could not hide the fact the Iraq crisis has made a
mockery of EU aspirations to craft a common foreign policy.

Britain, Spain, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands and Portugal back the
United States while France and Germany lead a group of nations
opposing military action.

``I would like to see that the European Union countries will come
through this difficult moment with a determination to work for peace
and look to the future,'' EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana said.

British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw remained in London for a debate
in which the Blair government sought parliamentary approval for its
decision to use ``all means necessary'' to disarm Saddam.

Blair was confident of retaining the support of a majority of
parliament as he can count on votes from opposition Conservatives. He
told the House of Commons the Iraq crisis was testing the
fundamentals of international relations.

``It will determine the way Britain and the world confront the
central security threat of the 21st century; the development of the
United Nations; the relationship between Europe and the United
States; the relations within the European Union; and the way that the
United States engages with the rest of the world,'' said Blair.

``It will determine the pattern of international politics for the
next generation,'' he said.

The EU foreign ministers met hours after U.S. President George W.
Bush gave Saddam 48 hours to leave Iraq or face invasion.

French President Jacques Chirac said war without U.N blessing would
undermine future disarmament efforts. ``Inspections (in Iraq) showed
that they are a credible alternativ,'' Chirac said. ``To act without
the legitimacy of the United Nations ... to favor the use of force
over law, is taking a serious responsibility.''

In Berlin, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said there was no
justification for war. ``Does the threat posed by the Iraqi dictator
justify a war, which is sure to kill thousands of innocent children,
women and men? My answer in this case was and is: No!'' Schroeder
said.

Solana said the EU would help in the humanitarian crisis expected to
follow an attack on Iraq. The EU is set to release 20 million euros
(US$21.5 million) in immediate humanitarian aid for Iraq if war
breaks out and may dip into an ``emergency reserve'' of 250 million
euros (US$269 million) for humanitarian relief.

Elsewhere in Europe:	 _  Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt,
overruling his defense minister, said his government would allow the
United States use of its territory for military transports. In recent
weeks, the U.S. military has been transporting military equipment
from bases in Germany to the Gulf through the port of Antwerp.
Defense Minister Andre Flahaut said on the weekend Belgium would no
longer allow such transits  _  or use of Belgian airspace.     _ 
Greece began evacuating its embassy in Baghdad, saying all its
personnel would be out of Iraq within a couple of days.     _  The
Dutch government, facing strong public anti-war pressure, said it
would not commit fighting forces to the war against Iraq but added it
supported the military campaign to disarm Saddam.     _  In neutral
Switzerland, Foreign Minister Micheline Calmy-Rey said the United
States' decision to proceed with military action weakened the United
Nations. ``It will be up to U.N. member states to restore its
credibility,'' she said.   (rw-pa-rac)
