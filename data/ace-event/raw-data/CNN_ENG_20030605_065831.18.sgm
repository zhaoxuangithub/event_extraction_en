martha stewart is one of those stories that is in the news big time
again. she resigned as chairman and ceo of martha stewart living,
omnimedia, the company that bears her name. after pleading not guilty
to a laundry list of charges brought by the justice department and the
sec, insider trading, obstruction of justice, conspiracy to hide what
they say is an illegal stock sale, we're talking about 4,000 shares of
stock that netted her about $225,000. how does this compare with other
corporate scandals? enron's bankruptcy cost thousands of people their
jobs and their life savings and kenny lay and the chairman and
president, both of that company remain unindicted. the chief financial
officer is the only one there taking the fall. worldcom once employed
80,000 people and went broke on the largest corporate bankruptcy in
the united states. bernie evers is living his life and unindicted. the
ceo took the fall there. tyco's ceo and president dennis kozlowski and
the last time i looked, he was sailing around martha vinyard on his
yacht. at the time, martha stewart was worth in the neighborhood of $1
billion, so you could make the argument she might have been guilty of
stupidity. but the question is she being unfairly singled out for
prosecution? the e-mail address is am@cnn.com. and i'm sure we'll hear
from many of you and we will select some of the responses and share
them with you a bit later. what makes something worth a billion
dollars have to grab the phone after losing two grand with a falling
stock price?
