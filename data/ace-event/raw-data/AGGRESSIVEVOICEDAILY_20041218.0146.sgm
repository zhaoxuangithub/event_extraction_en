San Francisco is apparently bored with just being the gay capital of
America and is trying to muscle out Washington DC for the prestigious
title of murder capital. It's possible, now that San Francisco officials
have proposed a law that mimics the infamous DC gun ban. Columnist
Michelle Malkin is one of the few columnists/bloggers who has picked up
on the story.

As I said in a previous post it's all up to the voters.
