Fallujah, Iraq.  Much of the country is unstable, but national
elections are still scheduled to take place in Iraq in January. Do you
think the US is doing the right thing in Iraq?  If not, what should we
be doing intstead?  Do you think the elections scheduled for January
will take place, and if not, then what?

</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Uh-huh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Allan </SPEAKER>
Um, yeah, ok- um, eh,  uh, it was talking something about, uh,  the
war in Iraq, um,  I guess, yeah, it's a good thing -- about the
elections that are going on.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Right.  I just talked to somebody from ~LA a couple days ago about
that on the -- survey line.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Allan </SPEAKER>
Oh, the-
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Um,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Allan </SPEAKER>
you got the same topic or-
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
yeah, I thought it was the same topic.  So,  huh.  So,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Allan </SPEAKER>
Uh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
do you think the elections are going to happen?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Allan </SPEAKER>
Sorry?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Do you think the elections are going to happen?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Allan </SPEAKER>
Yeah, I think the -- I think they're still they're going to go through
even though, uh, even though,  um, what's it called,  that you know of
all the -- turmoil that's happening there and all of the argu- you know,
and all the -- killings and everything. I think it'll still go through,
you know. The -- it's democracy, you know, you have to fight for it.
It's not -- it doesn't come easily, you know.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Right. Yeah, that's why I think it will, too, because they- they
pushed it in Iraq.  I mean, uh, excuse me, in Afghanistan.  They kept
on scheduling them and they we're saying, oh, no no no, you know.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Allan </SPEAKER>
Um,  yeah, I think -- you know I think they should have continued to go
through with it, and you know um -- if- if there is -- if there's
problems, you know, just -- still -- don't, you know -- just ignore it, keep
going, you know you can't -- stop, you know,if you already started
something, you know, you should complete it, I think.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Right.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Allan </SPEAKER>
I mean, if they leave -- if they leave, you know, if the- eh, let's
say they, you know, they just leave right now, you know, the the -- they
can't, you know, I don't think the -- the -- the occupants themselves
regain control and, you know, and mo- and, you know, and -- put down the
power and, you know, an- and control everything they can. They just
need they, you know, they need assistance and to get off -- get off,
you know, on the right step. I think they're going to need the
military to be in there.  And assist them with the elections and they
need to complete the elections and all this.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Yeah, um,  yeah, I don't know what the end game,  per se, is going to
be there, you know, because,  eh, they- the problem is the- is the
culture, you know, it's -- pretty, uh,  you know, it's really almost
like a modern day Crusades, you know, and that's- that's kind of hard,
you know. A lot of -- there's a lot of embitterment that goes back
generations and stuff, so,  you know, we have -- I don't know, I
always think we have such a short mindset,  uh, but they don't. So,
that's why,  uh, I- I don't know i- There's always going to be
problems there, I just don't -- I don't know how long we should -- be in
Iraq.  I mean, definitely to keep it stable.  I- -- eh, I just -- I- I
think the situation could be handled better. I- I thought it was a
great idea fir- them going in there -- and doing what they did but, uh,
they had a short window of opportunity to win over the people and it
didn't happen. I don't know if that was just out of our control or-
or what or if we could've done a better job but, uh,  you know.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Allan </SPEAKER>
Do you support the -- do you- do you support the war?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
What's that now?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Allan </SPEAKER>
Do you support the war?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Yeah. Yeah, I did at first I just- I just -- I -- don't like the way it
was managed. I think -- I think, uh, they did a great job up front, of
course. You know, they did militarily-wise,  they did an excellent job
but I think they've done a poor job,  you know,  reconstructing and
just controlling the situation. You know, they-
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Allan </SPEAKER>
Yeah, I- I agree also. Yeah, I- I mean, I- I did support the war. I
just think that when they went in there, you know they -- they just
didn't -- you know, they didn't i- execute everything correctly, you
know there was problems, you know.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Allan </SPEAKER>
And I think I mean, that that lead to it, but yeah, I mean they -- I
mean eh you know you're already in it, so you know, you shouldn't --
you can't just walk down and, you know, stop, you got to complete what
you're doing, you know.  So I
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Right.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Allan </SPEAKER>
Yeah, um.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
But, they- they definitely need to take a back seat to some sort --
you know, some sort of Iraqi government there. I know they set up the
council,  uh, interim council, but that hasn't gone,  you know, perfe-
smoothly.  Um, they still -- Americans have been calling the shots.
So, if they can just sort of make a -- be- get into more of a
supportive role and,  you know, flex their muscles when they need to
and maybe that will help- help,  uh,  squall some of the vi- the
violence. I don't know.  Eh,  if they could've -- if they could've
shored up the borders,  right after going in there, that would've been
a -- that would've been a- a big plus, you know.  I don't know if that
could, uh,  if that's a -- plausible goal or not because, uh, it's just
that- that -- a lot of that's, you know,  uh, weapons and terrorists
have been, you know, getting through the borders, probably from Syria.
