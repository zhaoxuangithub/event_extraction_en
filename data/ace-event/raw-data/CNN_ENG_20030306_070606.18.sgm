serving 25 to year life sentences under the three strikes
law. one-third of them -- not that. 300 of them are in
there for things like petty theft. 25 other states that
have the three strikes law. and that brings us to the
question. it was a close vote. 5-4 in the supreme court.

it suffered at the hands of its mother and she's free. five
years probation for killing her 4-year-old by scalding it
to death in the bathtub. that is the
