Back in 1996, budget cuts eliminated the job of State Archaeologist.
Now, according to the Virginian-Pilot , the job is about to come back
via HB 2078 . With all this surplus floating around and the Jamestown
2007 celebration coming up, who wants the state to be shorthanded in
archaeology?

The last State Archaeologist, Catherine Slusser, is still around,
according to the article, serving the Department of Historical
Resources. She describes the untenable ongoing situation with
archaeology budget cuts: "Few Virginia employees have attended national
conferences."

Though taxpayers are malcontent,

The Assembly won't refund a cent.

With so much to spend,

They followed the trend

And gave us a certified rodent .

Governor Mark, pudding and pie

Tax those citizens and make them cry

When the anti-taxers came out to play

Governor Mark ran away.
