us.

reporter: after so much suffering, his gentle smile said it all. two
weeks in hospital and ali is recovering fast. happily watching tom and
jerry on his mini television, his transformation from the pain-racked
boy who left baghdad. with the encouragement of his doctors, we
visited him in the intensive care unit. they're confident he won't be
here much longer.

i will say he will come out of the burn unit in three weeks time, but
he will be, you know, in kuwait until we find him really constructive
plan that takes into consideration all aspects of his needs,
psychological, social and future plan.

reporter: since ali is an ardent football fan, we gave him a
manchester united shirt specially signed by all the players. pride of
face went to his favorite player, david beckham, who surprised
everyone with his response.
