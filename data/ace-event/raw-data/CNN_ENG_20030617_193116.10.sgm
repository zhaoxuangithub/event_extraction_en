china today. a california family is now bigger by one. tonight they're
welcoming little abby kramer in the world was anything but simple. her

</TURN>
<TURN>

</TURN>
<TURN>

</TURN>

yes. actually, we did bring some masks.
</TURN>
<TURN>

</TURN>
<TURN>
we understand that's where the sars epidemic started from and we're
going right to the heart.
</TURN>
<TURN>
reporter: nothing will stop them. what would you tell her about
somehow she came to you and why she was given up?
</TURN>
<TURN>
the people that gave birth to you are not necessarily your mom and
dad. they're the ones that love you and care for you. we are.
</TURN>
<TURN>
reporter: finally, it's time to go. with the 16-hour flight to look
forward to --
</TURN>
<TURN>
it's been a total rollercoaster.
</TURN>
<TURN>

camera, they record their journey.
</TURN>
<TURN>
we just boarded the plane. the flight attendants are wearing masks.
</TURN>
<TURN>
reporter: the kramers decide not to. neither do the other 23 adoptive
families on the long overseas trip.
</TURN>
<TURN>
we just got off, so our 16-hour flight is over.
</TURN>
<TURN>
reporter: the families begin with a tour.
</TURN>
<TURN>
an alligator. my goodness.
</TURN>
<TURN>
reporter: the kramers must wait and travel to another town for abby.

</TURN>
<TURN>

</TURN>
<TURN>
reporter: finally the kramers meet abby.
</TURN>
<TURN>
hi, there.
</TURN>
<TURN>
i kind of leaned over and gave her a kiss on the forehead and she
looked up and --
</TURN>
<TURN>
reporter: they know little about their little girl, found by the side
of the road days after she was born. she spent most of her life in an
orphannage. now abby has a new life in california with the kramers and
their two kids.
</TURN>
<TURN>
i think i love her more every day, every time i look at her.
</TURN>
<TURN>
reporter: thelma gutierrez, cnn, los angeles.
</TURN>
<TURN>
well, it is our turn to meet the kramers back in the u.s. after their
journey to china to bring home the newest and cutest perhaps, member
of their family, in los angeles, the proud parents of 11 mnth abigail
kramer. thank you for being with us.
</TURN>
<TURN>
thank you for having us.
</TURN>
<TURN>
she is unbelievably adorable.
</TURN>
<TURN>
thanks.
</TURN>
<TURN>
tell us a little about this journey, that moment when you first saw
her. you traveled. this is going on two years, you battled
bureaucracy, traveling thousands of miles, facing disease. what was
that like?
</TURN>
<TURN>
incredible. you know, just to hold her in our arms, have her with us.
i mean, you count the moments. and it was just anticipation all the
way there. so it was relief. it was, you know, a dream come true. she
was -- she's really a delight. i mean, though it was a little
pandemonium at the moment, she's wonderful. we love her.
</TURN>
<TURN>
and, mark, it was -- the first time you were holding her, it looked
like she was crying a lot. she seemed startled to see someone that
looked so different.
</TURN>
<TURN>
yes, this was probably her first experience ever seeing a fair-
skinned, bearded goatee, monster looking guy and she just freaked out
the first time she saw me. it took about a day and a half for her to
warm up. i had to hide in the hotel room. she would find me in the
room and start crying every time she saw me.
</TURN>
<TURN>
you had to hide in the hotel room?
</TURN>
<TURN>
yeah, she'd find me across the room and break into tears. it was kind
of that way with anyone that was blond, that was fair-skinned.
</TURN>
<TURN>
yeah. when you first heard about sars, i mean, did you suddenly think,
this may not happen? this could stop the whole thing
</TURN>
<TURN>
sure. we got calls that morning saying "did you hear that they're
halting all travel?" and we put in a call to the agency. we were
going. and we put a lot of trust in our agency. and they were great.
you know, unless we were absolutely stopped, we were going.
</TURN>
<TURN>
right. after two years of working towards it, we were almost more
afraid not to go than to go at the very end.
</TURN>
<TURN>
you know, mark, i hope this isn't too personal a question. if it is,
just simply tell me to shut up. but when -- in the story i saw abby
was abandoned on the side of the road, which is just -- it's
unthinkable. you can't even imagine a parent doing that. what do you
think you're going to tell her when she grows up about how she came to
live with you?
</TURN>
<TURN>
well, i get emotional every time i -- someone asks that. but we're
going to give her the best love and affection we can and give her a
strong self esteem and we're going to teach her
