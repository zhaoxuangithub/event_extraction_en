Lynch Travels Back to U.S.; Is Life in Iraq Stabilizing?; Is Bush 
Administration Planning Other Regime Changes?
</HEADLINE>

<TURN>
<SPEAKER> WOODRUFF </SPEAKER>
A reminder, Jessica Lynch coming back to the United States within the
hour. Tonight, a special on the rescue of Jessica Lynch. That's at 8:30
p.m. Eastern, 5:30 Pacific. Well, after many trying months of defending
Saddam Hussein, Ambassador Mohammed Aldouri finally said the game is
over. Now, his tenure at the United Nations is over, too. Last night
before leaving the United States, Aldouri said he hopes to see free
elections in a free Iraq. CNN's Richard Roth has more on this once
prominent frontman for the Iraqi regime.

<SPEAKER> RICHARD ROTH, CNN SENIOR U.N. CORRESPONDENT (voice-over) </SPEAKER>
The last time Iraqi's U.N. ambassador addressed the Security Council, the
U.S. ambassador walked out in protest.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> MOHAMMED ALDOURI, IRAQI AMBASSADOR TO U.N. (through translator) </SPEAKER>
What happened is that the Iraqi army up until now has not confronted the
United States forces.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> ROTH </SPEAKER>
But now, it's the Iraqi ambassador's time to leave, the United States.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> ALDOURI </SPEAKER>
The game is over. I hope that peace will prevail, and that the Iraqi
people at the end of the day will have a peaceful life.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> ROTH </SPEAKER>
Mohammed Aldouri spent more years as a university professor than as a
diplomat. In New York, he briefed people interested in his country,
recently a group of Lehigh University students. But he never got
comfortable in the media glare before and especially during the war.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> UNIDENTIFIED MALE </SPEAKER>
You said you weren't...
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> ALDOURI </SPEAKER>
(UNINTELLIGIBLE) has happened with you? Please, why did you come here?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> UNIDENTIFIED MALE </SPEAKER>
Because we thought...
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> ALDOURI </SPEAKER>
Tomorrow, I will see you in the U.N.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> ROTH </SPEAKER>
And at the U.N., all ambassadors carry out their instructions whether
they agree with them or not.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> JUAN GABRIEL VALDES, CHILEAN AMBASSADOR TO U.S. </SPEAKER>
Well, I think that he had a very, very difficult task. He defended the
positions of his country with courage, I would say.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> JEREMY GREENSTOCK, BRITISH AMBASSADOR TO U.N. </SPEAKER>
He's a decent man, and I hope he finds a decent life representing a
decent government.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> UNIDENTIFIED MALE </SPEAKER>
Aldouri is a dear friend of mine.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> ROTH </SPEAKER>
Aldouri also drew support from opponents of the war a gift of paper
cranes. But on the eve of Aldouri's departure, women representing the
Daughters of the American Revolution passed by, wanting to let fly with
something else.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE </SPEAKER>
If I had eggs, I would like to throw eggs at him.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> ROTH </SPEAKER>
U.N. diplomats don't toss eggs, just nods. Several months ago, the U.S.
ambassador, John Negroponte, and the Iraqi ambassador almost locked eyes.
And forget about Kuwait.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> MOHAMMED ABULHASAN, KUWAITI AMBASSADOR TO U.N. </SPEAKER>
Nothing.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> UNIDENTIFIED MALE </SPEAKER>
Not one word?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> ABULHASAN </SPEAKER>
Not one word, except a normal greeting of, "Hello, how are you?"
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> ROTH </SPEAKER>
That was as close as residents of New York's Upper East Side district got
to know Aldouri, who kept a low profile, like many in the big city. It's
a neighborhood you wouldn't expect the diplomatic post of an enemy
government to turn up.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> ALDOURI </SPEAKER>
I am very thankful for the people of New York, for their generosity. This
is a very decent people. I was really -- without talking about the
problem in Iraq, I was really happy to be here in New York, within the
people of New York.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> ROTH </SPEAKER>
Aldouri was worried most about the people of Iraq.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> ALDOURI </SPEAKER>
When I see, what I've seen, what you see, my heart squeezes blood.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> ROTH </SPEAKER>
Aldouri was in better spirits as he departed for the airport with a final
message.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> ALDOURI </SPEAKER>
I hope that the United States Army will leave Iraq soon, and we will have
free election for a free government for a free future for Iraq and the
people for Iraq. This is my message to you, to the people of the United
States.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> ROTH </SPEAKER>
The ambassador's prime concern now: his family in Iraq. One day he hopes
to teach again back home. Richard Roth, CNN, United Nations.
</TURN>
(END VIDEOTAPE)
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> WOODRUFF </SPEAKER>
We'll try to track his progress and see if he's able to do that,
Ambassador Aldouri. Still ahead, looters cast about for new places to
loot, and chaos is king in Baghdad. We'll have a report.
