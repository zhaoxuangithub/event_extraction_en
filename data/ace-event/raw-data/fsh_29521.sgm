<TURN>
<SPEAKER> John </SPEAKER>
Uh-huh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ivan </SPEAKER>
they, uh,  tell you the same thing and then they turn around and -- do
something different all the time anyway, so it's -- I don't know if
it's, uh,  I guess it's wor- -- worth voting, but -- sometimes I wonder.

</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> John </SPEAKER>
Can't please everybody.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ivan </SPEAKER>
Yeah.  Yep.  And, uh, as far as what I thought of the various
candidates,  uh,  you know, I guess we -- said what we said about Bush,
but, uh,  Kerry, I don't know, it's just that -- -coast,  uh, kind of
persona or image,  -t, uh, I -- don't care for, for one thing.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> John </SPEAKER>
Uh-huh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ivan </SPEAKER>
From Massachusetts i- -- -candidate.

</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> John </SPEAKER>
Uh-huh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ivan </SPEAKER>
Uh,  uh, he's kind of a non-descript person, as far as, like I I'm
sure he's he's probably a nice guy, and -- a lot of fun at a party
probably, I don't know, but,  you know,  just from -- what you see of
him, he's just kind of -- kind of like an old grandpa, you know.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> John </SPEAKER>
Yeah, he's real grouchy.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ivan </SPEAKER>
Yeah, he just
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> John </SPEAKER>
In those debates he was like a pitbull.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ivan </SPEAKER>
Yeah, yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> John </SPEAKER>
You know, he would c- him and, uh,  I mean, uh,  I don't know, he he
kind of picked apart Edwards
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ivan </SPEAKER>
Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> John </SPEAKER>
and, um,  but then -- Edwards fought back kind of -- you know and then all
the stuff you hear about Edwards too, about the, uh,  how he's a trial
lawyer and how he made all his millions -- suing insurance companies
and, um, you know, there- there's -- bad stuff you hear about both of
them that, you know, obviously they want to tell you
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ivan </SPEAKER>
Yeah.  Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> John </SPEAKER>
that I didn't like.  And, I guess I didn't really like that, uh,  uh,
Kerry was, like, changing his story all the time, like, oh, I- -- I
believe in this but,  uh, no I don't but yes I do and,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ivan </SPEAKER>
Yeah.

</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> John </SPEAKER>
If you got an opinion I'd rather just want you to tell me straight up
and not
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ivan </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> John </SPEAKER>
try to beat around the bush to -- get my vote or something like that.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ivan </SPEAKER>
Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I guess to a certain degree they -- they,  uh, I
guess try to play to the middle and try to -- please as many people as
they can but Kerry was just all over the map.
</TURN>
<TURN>
