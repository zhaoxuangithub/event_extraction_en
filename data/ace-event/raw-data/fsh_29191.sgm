3. Bush Cabinet President Bush has just been elected to another term
in office, and he has already started to appoint new people to his
political cabinet as current members like Colin Powell and John
Ashcroft resign.  Who would you like to see appointed to his cabinet
next term?  Who are they, and why do you think they should be
appointed? If you were president, which national figures would you
appoint to your cabinet and why?  What new cabinet positions would you
create and who would fill them?

</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ron </SPEAKER>
So uh what do you think about the uh topic of discussion this evening?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sherri </SPEAKER>
I've been sort of surprised. Eh uh I -- I heard uh that Colin Powell
wanted um -- to resign last year and they talked him out of it.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ron </SPEAKER>
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sherri </SPEAKER>
Or something like that and uh so -- I was still surprised this year when
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ron </SPEAKER>
Oh thi- you were surprised that he yo- that he decided to step down.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sherri </SPEAKER>
yeah I I I still was uh -- kind of surprised.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ron </SPEAKER>
Oh, huh, how interesting.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sherri </SPEAKER>
eh -- And uh -- and then uh with Condoleezza Rice. They're appointing her
ta- to a new position, and I was surprised about Ashcroft.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ron </SPEAKER>
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sherri </SPEAKER>
I wasn't like it and then Tom Ridge yesterday.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ron </SPEAKER>
Yeah, I saw that. Yeah, I I uh that one I think one probably was the
one that most surprised me. I hadn't I hadn't really thought about it.
I -- Colin Powell didn't surprise me. Ashcroft surprised me a little bit
um but um I sort of started to think he might step down because
evidently he was being he was considered somewhat of a lightning rod
for um you know some of his more controversial stands and stuff so.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sherri </SPEAKER>
Uh-huh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ron </SPEAKER>
But and and so have you been following the uh the proposed nominees? I
mean do you think
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sherri </SPEAKER>
Kellogg, the Kellogg guy.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ron </SPEAKER>
Oh yeah, that's right. Where's he going to Commerce? Is that where
he's headed?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sherri </SPEAKER>
Yeah, that's it, huh?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ron </SPEAKER>
Yeah, I don't know anything about him. I I don't know. Do you know
anything about him?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sherri </SPEAKER>
Mm.  Well, all I know is that that's like a real prestigious uh
position, you know to be the what the ~CEO of Kellogg?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ron </SPEAKER>
Yeah, yeah. I guess it sort of concerns me that uh you know we're
looking at yet uh another corporate head coming into the government. I
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sherri </SPEAKER>
Mm.  Ye- ye- you know, this is like a -- uh it's a re- -- I think we have
a real problem.  That is uh -- you know almost like a big beast you know
that's right there and we don't even identify it
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ron </SPEAKER>
Uh-huh.  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sherri </SPEAKER>
way way way more than we realize.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ron </SPEAKER>
Yeah, I I think you're probably right and I think it -- maybe even
particularly true under this President, although I don't think it's
just limited to him. I think it's a common problem in the ~US.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sherri </SPEAKER>
I f- -- I uh I think i- i- it's uh more evident now than ever.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ron </SPEAKER>
Uh-huh, uh-huh
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sherri </SPEAKER>
You know, really um -- tremen- tremendously a ruling and reigning.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ron </SPEAKER>
Did you um
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sherri </SPEAKER>
I think it it's a global uh has a global effect.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ron </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sherri </SPEAKER>
I think that's why Al-Qaeda -- took down the the uh twin towers.  Eh w-
they were making a a statement.  Uh I think something like that
possibly, that it had to do with corporate America.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ron </SPEAKER>
Uh-huh, you mean about the corporate thing?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sherri </SPEAKER>
Hm?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ron </SPEAKER>
Uh you mean because of its -- what it represented around corporate
America or something? Is that what you think.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sherri </SPEAKER>
I think what corporate America represents -- you know the the financial
scheme of it all, the
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ron </SPEAKER>
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sherri </SPEAKER>
the it just how it eff- effects the globe,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ron </SPEAKER>
Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sherri </SPEAKER>
and how eh it effects third world countries and you know just the
whole thing. It's just
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ron </SPEAKER>
Mhm, mhm.  Uh-huh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sherri </SPEAKER>
it's a you know like a a a wealthy despotism or something like that.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ron </SPEAKER>
So any thoughts on who you uh you would name?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sherri </SPEAKER>
(()) -- You know who I would name? I know this is really wild.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ron </SPEAKER>
Do you suppose?  Uh-huh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sherri </SPEAKER>
But uh I don't know you'll probably really laugh but I don't know, I
I I always thought that -- Ralph Nader was kind of a a character
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ron </SPEAKER>
Oh.  Uh-huh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sherri </SPEAKER>
but what I really I mean I really listened to what he said when he was
being interviewed
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ron </SPEAKER>
Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sherri </SPEAKER>
and in just a few words, he didn't mince any meat or anything,  in a
few words he said so much that was so
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ron </SPEAKER>
Uh-huh.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sherri </SPEAKER>
like -- like a clarion call it rang so clear. You could hear what he was
saying and it was really making sense, and I think he's an expert
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ron </SPEAKER>
So who would y- what would you appoint him to?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sherri </SPEAKER>
on
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ron </SPEAKER>
Any particular position? I mean, I think that's a good idea.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sherri </SPEAKER>
eh -- there's something to do with the economy y- you know for the with
the to deal with the
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ron </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Sherri </SPEAKER>
just uh -- like a an equa- e- economic equilibrium or something.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Ron </SPEAKER>
He might be be good at -- yeah, he might be good at commerce instead of
that Kellogg's guy.
