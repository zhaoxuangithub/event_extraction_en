So far, the Yukos auction has produced more questions than answers,
and so far the biggest of the former is just who made off with their
prize assets. Auctioneers reported a $9.3 billion winning bid for
Yuganskneftgaz -- the company's main asset, worth two to three times
that amount -- by an anonymous company located in Tver. Well, sort of.
It turns out the anonymous company, BaikalFinansGroup, shares an address
with OOO Tverneftemash, which was recently bought by ZAO
Gazpromgeocomservice, not to ever be confused by the similarly-named
Gazprom (which by the way has a similar logo). Gazprom, of course, is
the gigantic, Kremlin-supported gas company most observers assumed would
bid for the assets. There aren't many groups in Russia who can afford a
$9.3 billion bet, particularly when it's such a politically-weighted
one. Gazprom may have arranged some last-minute debt financing, or might
have an outside partner, but I seriously doubt they weren't in some way
involved with the company that won the auction.
