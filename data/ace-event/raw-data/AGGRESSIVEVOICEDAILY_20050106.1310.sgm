Feminists have a reason to celebrate today as an appeals court just
threw out the convictions of their martyr, Andrea Yates, by ruling that
one of the prosecutor's expert witnesses gave false testimony at her
trial.

Yates, in case you have forgotten, is the women from Texas who
heinously drowned her five kids, aged 6 months to 7 years, one by one,
in her bathtub. Liberal feminist organizations rushed to Yates' defense,
most notably the National Organization for Women, which provided money
for her defense fund and held candlelight vigils. No such ceremonies
were held for her five dead children.

In 2002 a jury sentenced Yates to life in prison for the deaths of
three of her children. She was not tried in the deaths of the other two.
Today the 1st Court of Appeals overturned the convictions and ordered a
new trial. We can only hope for the same verdict.
