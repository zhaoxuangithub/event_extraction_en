Well, rescued American prisoner of war Jessica Lynch is expected to
arrive at Ramstein air base in Germany just about an hour from now. CNN
will have live coverage of her arrival. Lynch was rescued in a daring
raid by U.S. forces on the Saddam hospital in Nasiriya. This nightscope
video shows troops carrying the 19-year-old Army private to a Blackhawk
helicopter. We know, though, that 11 bodies were also recovered in this
operation, and military officials say they are working now to identify
them. When she's in Germany, Lynch will be treated for bullet wounds and
broken bones. She's reported to be in stable condition. She and more than
a dozen other members of her Army maintenance unit were ambushed near
Nasiriya more than a week ago.

Meantime in Palestine, West Virginia, there is a lot of joy over the news
of Jessica Lynch's rescue. Her father, mother and other family members
say they never gave up hope, despite their fears of what might have
happened. And they say they are grateful to her rescuers.

I can't really say how the military is functioning over there because I'm
not there. But they are doing a job, you know, I don't know the thoughts
of the soldiers, the men and women that went into that building and
brought her out. They are heroes in my book.

She was rescued in a daring effort by the brave Army rangers and Navy
SEALS. And today she is safe. Safe. Safe once again. Her state of West
Virginia is relieved. Her community is exuberant. Her family is
overjoyed. I spoke with Jessica Lynch's father last evening and shared
