israeli helicopter air strikes against palestinian targets, hamas
targets in gaza. a number of people have been killed in the first
airstrike, two palestinians were killed, a mother and a child
apparently. a hamas leader was injured in that strike. he's now in a
palestinian hospital. in the second apache helicopter airstrike that
occurred within the past hour or so, we're now told by palestinians,
three people died, 33 others were wounded, six are in critical
condition, three dead were civilians, according to palestinian
sources. we're going to continue to monitor that story for our
viewers. we're also checking out other developments right now,
including this story that's just coming in from the associated press
right now. i just want to get it from our computers. sam waksal has
been sentenced to more that seven years in prison, ordered to pay $4
million in fines and back taxes in connection with the insider trading

getting word of his sentence from the federal judge. seven years in
prison, actually more than seven years in prison, $4 million in fines
