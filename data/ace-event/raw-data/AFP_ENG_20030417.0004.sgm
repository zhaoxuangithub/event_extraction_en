GUWAHATI, India, April 17 (AFP)

At least three members of a family in Indias northeastern state of
Tripura were hacked to death by a tribal mob for allegedly practicing
witchcraft, police said Thursday.

A spokesman said a group of 25 to 30 armed men Wednesday attacked a
house belonging to a village quack doctor in Tultuli, 60 kilometers
(38 miles) south of Tripuras state capital Agartala.

"The mob dragged out three members of a family and (killed) them with
machetes and spears before fleeing the area," the spokesman said by
telephone from Agartala.

The dead included the quack doctor, 55-year-old Nityalila Naotia, his
teenaged son and another member of the family, whom he did not
identify.

"It was believed Naotia was a practicing sorcerer and through his
black magic he had cast evil spells on villagers, prompting a group
within the village to eliminate them," the spokesman said.

Police have arrested four people in connection with the killings.

Superstitious beliefs, black magic and demonology are integral to the
tribal custom in parts of Tripura and other northeast Indian states.

Many tribes practice faiths believed to be a mix of black magic and
superstition.
