up with Kurdish militia

Kurdish militiamen and U.S. special operations troops linked up with
more than 1,000 U.S. Army paratroopers Thursday to secure the area
around a strategic air strip, as the first large coalition ground
force in northern Iraq began opening another front against Saddam
Hussein's regime.

The Army's 173rd Airborne Brigade , including elite Army Rangers,
jumped out of low-flying C-17 transport planes under cover of
darkness Wednesday and secured a snow-dusted airfield, which will be
used to bring in supplies and support personnel.

The airdrop  _	one of the biggest paratroop drops in decades  _ was
a dramatic entry for ground troops into a region where only small
groups of U.S. special forces have been operating. Coalition
airstrikes have been hitting Iraqi military forces and other
strategic targets in the north.

``This tightens the noose against Saddam's forces battling coalition
forces to the south,'' Brig. Gen. James Parker, commander of U.S.
forces in the north. ``And it may also serve as a warning to Turkish
forces.''

Giving cover for the deployment, U.S. warplanes struck Iraqi ground
troops and bunkers in northern Iraq. Three waves of combat planes
from the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt hit ``ground troops,
command and control bunkers, artillery positions and ... a surface to
air missile battery,'' said Lt. John Oliveira, the ship's public
affair officer.

Around dawn Thursday, strikes resumed, with a massive explosion just
outside the Kurdish zone close to the village of Kalak. Warplanes
pounded forward Iraqi positions in the hills overlooking Chamchamal,
35 kilometers (22 miles) east of the key oil city of Kirkuk.

Later Thursday, Kurdish troops in Chamchamal advanced their positions
between government-controlled and rebel-controlled areas, taking over
a Iraqi check point on their front with no fighting at this point,
witnesses said.

Early Thursday, Kurdish fighters closed off a highway and roads near
the airstrip where troops were said to be arriving, outside the town
of Bashur, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) northeast of the
Kurd-controlled city of Irbil and 30 miles (50 kilometers) south of
the Turkish border.

From the highway, dusted from a recent snow, a flashing light from
the airstrip's control tower was visible in the distance, and three
helicopters could be seen landing, flying with nearly all their
lights extinguished.

Future airlifts into the area will include supplies and support
personnel for the 173rd's fighters, defense officials said. The
airfield's 6,700-foot (2,042-meter) runway is long enough to land
C-17s and other U.S. military cargo planes.

Lt. Col. Thomas Collins, a spokesman for the U.S. Army's Southern
European Task Force, refused to say whether the paratroopers deployed
directly from Italy into Iraq or had taken a different route.

The matter immediately sparked controversy in Italy, where there is a
strong anti-war movement. The country's parliament voted this month
to allow U.S.-led coalition forces to use Italian air space and
military bases	_  but not for directs attacks on Iraq.

Pentagon officials have said for weeks they would have U.S. forces in
northern Iraq to open another front against Saddam's forces. The vast
majority of the coalition ground troops in Iraq are moving toward
Baghdad from the south after entering from Kuwait.

Pentagon officials had hoped to have the Army's 4th Infantry Division
invade Iraq from the north, but Turkey balked at allowing up to
62,000 U.S. troops on its soil to prepare for that option. The use of
the 173rd shows the military has shifted to a smaller, lighter force.

Military officials say they would have liked to have secured key oil
fields around the northern cities of Mosul and Kirkuk  _  and perhaps
the cities themselves  _  by now.

Though no hostilities were expected during the deployment, the 173rd
decided to parachute in rather then ferry troops in by plane so that
a significant combat force could mass almost immediately to protect
itself, officers said, according to a U.S. reporter traveling with
the 173rd.

``Kirkuk is key. The Iraqi's want it, the Kurds want it, the Turks
want it and various other ethnic groups also want it,'' Maj. Mike
Hastings said. ``What this drop means is that we can secure it until
we are relieved by other forces.''

Besides Mosul and Kirkuk, another key target in northern Iraq is
Tikrit, Saddam's hometown and the tribal center for most of his inner
circle. Most of the Adnan Division of the Republican Guard relocated
from the Mosul area to the Tikrit area shortly before the war began.

Another key mission for the 173rd could be to keep order in northern
Iraq, which is controlled by two semi-autonomous Kurdish factions but
also includes several splinter groups and a base for the
al-Qaida-linked Ansar al-Islam.

Turkey has said it may send more troops into northern Iraq to prevent
refugees from moving north, while U.S. officials have said they
advised Turkey against sending large additional forces into northern
Iraq.
