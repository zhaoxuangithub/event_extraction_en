Jim, you're not the only one mining the data on political
contributions. Over at the blog sic semper tyrannis , "Addison" has an
interesting post on the top donors to Speaker Howell's PAC.

Jim and Will:

Have some fun and check the "Northern Virginia Supporters" on the
Baril web site. Just the folks who support his father-in-law on the
condition he support their road plans.

Just wanted to add this to the discussion - I recently received this
press release from the Werkheiser campaign in NOVA - might this be the
ONLY COMPETITIVE RACE THIS YEAR?!??! Pathetic...

WERKHEISER OUT-RAISES OPPONENT AND LEADS CHALLENGERS STATEWIDE

Greg Werkheiser, candidate for the House of Delegates from the 42nd
District in southern Fairfax County, has raised significantly more money
to date than his incumbent opponent, David Albo, and leads all
challengers statewide in fundraising, according to reports filed with
the State Board of Elections on January 18, 2005.

Werkheiser out-raised his opponent by almost 2 to 1: Werkheiser
$81,615; Albo $55,119.

Werkheiser now has twice as much unencumbered cash on hand as his
opponent: Werkheiser $50,017; Albo $23,767

Werkheiser's contributions come from 200 individuals; Albo had 8
individual contributors.

Werkheiser leads all challengers statewide in total contributions
raised and funds on-hand.

The 42nd House of Delegates District forms the southern tip of
Fairfax County. Nearly fifty-two percent of the district voted for John
Kerry in 2004, and Governor Mark Warner won the district with similar
margins in 2001.

"I am humbled by the support of so many citizens in the 42nd District
who are voting with their pocketbooks for a change in leadership. While
we are very pleased with this outpouring of support, I am going to keep
doing what I have been doing: listening to my neighbors and working to
make our communities in Fairfax County a better place to live, work and
raise a family," stated Werkheiser.
