<SUBJECT> U.S. provoked Japan? </SUBJECT>

I hear discussion along the lines that the United States was *wanting* to go
to war with Japan, and had been trying to bring that about for years.

Any recognized books that develop this thesis; is there a definitive work?

I've read quite a few more rational works describing how the US was
doing its best to avoid, or at the very least postpone, a war against
Japan, mainly because FDR was trying to provoke Hitler to war and
didn't need a distraction on another distant front.

(stuff deleted)

The thesis has been expounded by several conspiracy theorists, mainly
the ones who expounded that FDR knew Pearl Harbor was about to be
attacked, and let it happen. One of their "proofs" was that the US
carriers were out of port during the attack, and "everybody knew"
carriers were the capital ship of the future.

However, the two carriers operating out of Pearl at the moment were
sent West with light escort, on possibly intersecting routes with the
IJN Kido Butai, which had far more carriers and a far heavier escort.
Even stranger, the USS Enterprise was scheduled to be at Pearl by Dec
6th, but got delayed by a storm.

Consequently, for the PH conspiracy theorists to believe that FDR kept
the carriers out of harm's way, we not only have to grant FDR the full
knowledge of Kido Butai's route of approach would not result in either
USN carrier fleet getting caught in a hopeless battle, but that FDR
could psychically manipulate the weather to prevent Halsey from sailing
into Pearl and thus be ambushed.

To make a very long story short, it is foolish to assume that the US
wanted to go to war against Japan prior to 1941, considering the weight
of evidence arguing against a US desire for war, and the overwhelming
lack of evidence (not to mention rational thought) arguing for a US
desire for war.

Here's something I wrote as part of a larger article, some while ago:

Wasn't Japan just defending herself when she attacked the US?

This line of reasoning seems to derive from arguments that Japan was being
"driven into a corner" by sanctions, and had no choice but to attack
the US. Meiji Japan was driven to emulate what it thought the West was
doing in every facet of society. They had observed, for example, that the
West was able to carve up China into "Spheres of Influence", and was able
to do from great distances, while they, the Japanese, had had limited
success in their previous attempts to dominate the Korean peninsula,
much less China. As part of the catch-up effort, she whole-heartedly
entered into the Imperialist game in Asia, being treated as an equal
(relative to her power) by the other powers. However, after World War
I, Japan failed to recognize a fundamental shift in the attitudes of her
former Imperial partners; they began a long, slow process of disengaging
themselves from their former Imperial areas, from their colonies, in
addition to outright stopping all expansions. Japan chose to read this
as a sign that the West had lost its power and resolve, and that Japan
was the rightful heir to Imperial mantle in Asia. With the deaths of
many of the idealistic leaders who had led Japan's rise to international
prominence, and the refusal of the US to intervene in Asian affairs,
in addition to the Bolshevik revolution and the stripping of possessions
from Germany, Britain found herself alone in dealing with an increasingly
aggressive Japan in the area. Having a keen grasp of the obvious, she
began a policy of acceding to Japanese hegemony in the area.

Japan continued a policy of acquiring territory for some grand, illusive
scheme of a "Greater Asia", subordinate and grateful to Japan. The
reality of this was that only a single possession, Manchuria, was
profitable to the Japanese, and the rest of the Empire turned out to
be a drain. This drain was greatly accelerated by Japan's invasion of
China proper in 1936. It was a war that Japan assumed would be ended
in "3 to 6 months"; at the time of Pearl Harbor, it had been going on
for 5 years, at the cost of over half a million Japanese lives. The
war put a tremendous strain on Japan (and was in fact opposed by more
radically NATIONALISTIC elements, as taking away from the development
of Japan's other possessions, particularly in the areas of scrap metal
and fuel.) Domestic consumption fell, consumer goods became scarce,
and the use of materiale for war purposes ate into Japan's domestic
industry. This cut further into her foreign reserves, exacerbating the
economic impact of the war. The war effort took on a life of its own,
however, and common sense was subordinated to it. Japan expanded into
areas of China and Indochina which had no strategic value to her, but put
her in a position to threaten British and Dutch possessions in the area;
possessions that both those Allied nations needed in order to continue
their fight against Hitler. At this point, the US stopped ignoring the
Japanese threat, and imposed a series of escalating sanctions on Japan,
cutting off her scrap metal, limitting and then cutting off her oil
(Japan imported most of both from the US.) While Japanese officials
realized that they had enough of each resource for Japan to do well IF
THE WAR IN CHINA STOPPED, they were powerless over the military they
were supposed to control. An abortive attack on Soviet positions in
Mongolia had placed Japan's focus firmly south, towards the possessions
of the US' future allies. For no reason anyone could articulate, Japan
felt she had to continue the war in China. To continue the war in China,
she had to have resources of oil and metal. To have these resources,
she must seize them, if others refused to sell them. In order to seize
them, she felt she had to attack and destroy the naval power of the US.

Thus, for a "3 to 6 month" operation in China in 1937, Japan would embark
on a war that would strip her of all the possessions and industries
she had acquired in 70 years. she must seize them, if others refused
to sell them. In order to seize them, she felt she had to attack and
destroy the naval power of the US.

Thus, for a "3 to 6 month" operation in China in 1937, Japan would embark
on a war that would strip her of all the possessions and industries she
had acquired in 70 years.
