<SUBJECT> Ethical and legal issues in hiring Marinello </SUBJECT>

It has been suggested that there is, or was at one time, some sort of
delegates' motion which established a minimum period between the time
someone could leave the EB and the time someone could be hired by the USCF.
I don't know if this is so, and I really think it's sort of irrelevant.

It's irrelevant because the REAL question is whether an active board member
can, while on the board, arrange to be given money by the USCF. Of course
it's in the bylaws that an active board member cannot be given money by the
USCF while on the board. It ought to be pretty obvious that it would be
entirely contrary to the spirit of this for an active board member to be
money after leaving the board. Suppose, for example, there were to be a
proposal to the effect that each EB member would be given $10,000 upon the
expiration of his/her term. Clearly this would be a transparent attempt to
evade the bylaws and would fail. If the board cannot vote to give
themselves present money, they cannot vote to give themselves future money
either.

Furthermore, it doesn't matter whether this arrangement is embodied in an EB
vote or not, or whether the discussion of the proposal takes place in a
formal EB meeting or not. A board member, while on the board, is supposed
to be representing the interests of the USCF, not feathering his/her nest,
in the present or in the future. If a board member makes such arrangements,
it is clearly an ethics violation, clearly a violation of the bylaws,
possibly endangers our tax-exempt status, and is possibly a violation of law
as well.

The purpose of having a "time limit" would be as a mechanism to ensure
compliance with the above principles; that is, you would have a time limit
because it would reduce the likelihood that someone would be tempted to
violate the above prohibition; it would give the voters time to elect a new
EB that would consider the issues objectively.

Of course, it is possible that someone could leave the board -without- ever
having discussed being compensated by the board in the future, and that then
the remaining members could, for good reason, hire that person. It would
create questions among the suspicious - and avoiding this appearance of
wrongdoing would be another good reason for a time limit - but it wouldn't
automatically be an ethics or bylaws violation.

But this is neither here nor there, because the fact that Randy Bauer is
already talking about Beatriz Marinello as the USCF's new "move
coordinator", whatever that involves, and whether or not it means that she
would be the de facto interim ED, means that at some level and in some form
these discussions HAVE already taken place, while Marinello is serving as
President. I mean, it's conceivable that the other six have all gotten
together in Marinello's absence and drafted her, but it also seems pretty
clear that she has agreed to do it, and, if all the rumors are true and she
steps down, it will be so that she can take on these new responsibilities.
So the 'time limit' issue doesn't even come up. We pretty much know that
Marinello, while on the board, has arranged to get future money from the
USCF. So we already have a problem. If this is NOT a problem, I wish
someone would explain to me why not.

Now, Stan B. argues that Marinello's services are in fact indispensible as
move coordinator, and that ethics standards are not a suicide pact, so that
since we absolutely NEED her the EB has the right to go ahead and retain
her. I agree with the principle. But I think that to make this argument
work the EB would have to produce some evidence that Marinello really IS
indispensible for this task. This would have to include evidence that the
EB had considered all the alternatives, including:

- delegating the whole thing to the Interim ED, which would be the normal
practice in normal organizations with an ED

- asking the Interim ED to designate someone from the New Windsor staff to
act as move coordinator

- asking the Interim ED to hire some other consultant with experience in
office relocation to manage the job (there are such people)

- conducting some kind of actual search for candidates for the position
during the last two months since the move was decided upon

If they did consider alternatives, it would also have to include evidence
that Marinello has much more experience at relocating offices than other
people, or is willing to do the job cheaper (although this wouldn't
constitute being "indispensible" in my view).

If, however, they just looked around the room and said "who is going to
manage this?" and someone said, "Beatriz, how about you?", this does not
constitute proof that her services are indispensible, and thus it wouldn't
interfere with my belief that there has been an ethics violation and a
bylaws violation.

One very bad argument that was made by Kevin Bachler, which to be fair was
surrounded by arguably better ones, was that since this board was elected,
we should let them do as they please. Which is to say that there might as
well not be bylaws, ethics standards, laws, etc., since an elected board is
not bound by any of them. I think this idea should be rejected.

Another argument, which is better but still disturbing, is that, yes, this
is an ethics violation, and maybe worse, but it would only hurt the USCF to
talk about it, and that only troublemakers like Sam Sloan, Larry Parr, and,
I suppose, me, would talk about it, since doing so will obstruct the
federation's plans, cause us to pay legal expenses, run the risk of our
being stuck without any office space at all, cause people not to loan us
money, and so forth. So we should all ignore this because it is realistic
to do so. I'm not entirely unsympathetic to this, actually. But frankly I
think that a whole lot of the problems the USCF has had over the years have
had to do with well-intentioned people keeping secrets because bringing them
out in the open would harm the USCF, and as a result we have awful habits
which hurt the USCF even worse.

But if we are going to talk about realism, here is another realistic
concern: I predict that, if, in fact, the rumors about the agenda for the
Florida meeting prove true, and Marinello resigns as President and is hired
as move coordinator, the immediate result of this is that Sam Sloan will
file another lawsuit (or amend his current complaint) charging the USCF EB
members with self-dealing, violation of the USCF's own bylaws, and every
other thing, report us to the IRS, and demand that all USCF moneys which
might be used to paid Marinello be frozen. This is not based on any
communication from Sam, direct or indirect. It is just logical. If he is
willing to file a lawsuit on the basis of New York non-profit organization
law, which might or might not be applicable to the USCF, why wouldn't he
file a lawsuit on the basis of the USCF's violation of its own bylaws, which
unquestionably ARE applicable to the USCF? I wrote a few days ago quoting
my own employer association's attorney, who said that courts mostly let
associations do what they want UNLESS they violate their own bylaws. It is
irritating enough to get sued by Sam Sloan; imagine how irritating it would
be to get sued by Sam Sloan and BEATEN by Sam Sloan because you have done
something so egregious that a court is forced to agree with him.
