Letter writing, you know, is sometimes called a lost art in this age of
electronic communication. But it is being rediscovered by U.S. troops in
Iraq, at least some of them. Karl Penhaul is with an Army attack
helicopter battalion in the town of Najaf in southeastern Iraq.

War, soldiers say, is long hours of boredom, followed by a few moments of
madness. Away from the thick of the action, soldiers' minds turn to
family, friends and lovers. No phones, no e-mail, letters are the only
link to home. Melony Marshall was married just a month before she left
for Iraq.

<SPEAKER> PFC MELONY MARSHALL, U.S. ARMY </SPEAKER>
"Hi, sweetheart. How you doing? I haven't received mail in two days.
Being out here in the heat, it is so exhausting. My love for you grows
stronger every day. The tent, I have to come home to seven people that,
they are not so bad half the time. But, sometimes, you need time away
from people. I miss you more and more. I'm ready to come home. When I get
home, I don't want to see a camera. I don't want to see a band. I don't
want to see a formation. I just want to come home."

<SPEAKER> CWO JOHN DAVIS, U.S. ARMY </SPEAKER>
"Dear Keegan (ph), Britney (ph) and Josh (ph), I'm doing fine, as is the
rest of the battalion. I really miss you guys a lot. And I can hardly
wait for the day I can be with you again. In hindsight, I look back and
see plenty of opportunities which I could have used to be a better
father, but yet let slip by. It's unfortunate that it's taken yet another
separation from you for me to realize this. Perhaps I can do better when
I get home."

"Hey, Ashley (ph), how you doing? Me, I'm hot as hell out here. For the
last two nights, we woke up to put our gas masks on for no reason. Our
little section gets the information last, or the best we can get. I guess
nobody cared enough to inform the cooks."

In his previous letter home, Apache pilot Joe Bruhl didn't tell his
family the full details about his first combat mission. Now he's trying
to set the record straight.

<SPEAKER> 1ST LT. JOE BRUHL, U.S. ARMY </SPEAKER>
"In my previous letter, written less than two days removed, I only wanted
to convey my safety. We did receive heavy fire and many of our aircraft
took significant hits, including mine. I tell you all this not to worry
you, but to give you comfort knowing what you hear and see is true and
that, despite that, I am safe and will continue to be.

<SPEAKER> PENHAUL (on camera) </SPEAKER>
Different ranks, different anxieties, but all are hoping, by the time
their letters get back to the U.S., they too will soon be heading home.

Very poignant. And I bet that father is a better father than he gives
himself credit for being. That's it for this special edition of INSIDE
POLITICS. I'm Judy Woodruff.
