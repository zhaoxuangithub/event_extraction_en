Thanks to Captain Ed for bringing this up. Apparently James Baker,
former Secretary of State and current envoy for the Bush Administration,
has asked the Isreali government to release a scumbag terrorist to
promote "peace". There is now. . . . in an Israeli prison a man named
Marwan Barghouti, who is one of the young guard of Palestinians, and if
the Palestinians are going to make this work against the really
hard-line elements, the Islamists and some of the people of Hamas,
they're going to have to have a coalition of the young guard and the old
guard." Gotta say that this shocked me, I've always thought Mr. Baker
was a upstanding guy but this is just plain good old fashioned bullcrap.

Here are some of the fine achievements of the terrorist Marwan
Barghouti Marwan Barghouti (born June 6, 1958) is a Palestinian leader
from the West Bank and a leader of the Fatah movement that forms the
backbone of the Palestinian Authority and the Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO). On June 6, 2004, he was sentenced to five life
sentences for five murders of Israeli civilians and 40 years
imprisonment for attempted murders in terrorist attacks against Israeli
civilians. Barghouti was one of the major leaders of the First Intifada
in 1987, leading Palestinians in a mass uprising against Israeli
occupation of the West Bank. During the uprising, he was arrested by
Israel and deported to Jordan, where he stayed for seven years until he
was permitted to return under the terms of the Oslo Accords in 1994. In
1996, he was elected to the Palestinian Legislative Council, in which he
advocated peace with Israel, sometimes coming in conflict with Yasser
Arafat. The formal position occupied by Barghouti was the General
Secretary of Fatah in the West Bank.

By the summer of 2000, Barghouti and Arafat had grown increasingly at
odds with each other, with Barghouti accusing Arafat's administration of
corruption and his security services of human rights violations, and
Arafat was planning to fire him shortly.

However, as the Second Intifada began, Barghouti became increasingly
popular as a leader of the Fatah Tanzim militia. This was perhaps due to
the transformation of Tanzim into an organization more resembling
militant groups like Hamas and Islamic Jihad, responsible for dozens of
civilian deaths in drive-by shootings. Under Barghouti, the Tanzim has
also carried out suicide bombings in Israel under the name al-Aqsa
Martyrs' Brigades.

What is he thinking? Release a known terrorist to run the PLO and
that will bring about peace, give me a effin break
