the nasa and the european space agency both launch missions
to mars this month sending rovers and ashters to probe the
red planet. one of the big questions about mars is when or
whether humans will ever be able to visit. it's an idea
plagued with unsolved problems. the latest issue of
"popular science magazine" takes a look at the challenges
nasa is facing. joining us is the contributing editor. good
to see you, jeff.
</TURN>
<TURN>
thank you.
</TURN>
<TURN>
it was only about 30 years ago when we went to the moon. so
what's the difficulty in being able to go to mars?
</TURN>
<TURN>
it's unimaginably difficult and different. mars is at most
times 100 million miles away from us. it's a nine-month
trip. then if we stay there for about a year or two, the
whole trip could last about three years. we're talking
about conditions where there's radiation in space cosmic
radiation that could cause cancer. the communications
conditions once you're on mars, just to talk to people on
earth, there's a 20 minute delay in the conversation. so
the -- you know, the issues are so much larger than going
to the moon.
</TURN>
<TURN>
and for now, it's 250 days, which seems to be the maximum
for astronauts in space anyway. but as you say, it's a much
further travel. but let's talk about some of the hurdles
that hamper humans to be able to survive there. the dust,
for one thing. cataracts another. let's talk about the
right kind of spacecraft that would be able to allow humans
to actually get that far and to survive.
</TURN>
<TURN>
right. well, first of all, the spacecraft would not be
launched from earth. you'd have to launch is from in space
already, which means we would have to build it in space. so
that means we need a good shuttle that's going to take us
back and forth to build the spacecraft. then we have to
come up with the fuel that will take it out of the earth's
orbit all the way to mars. that's probably going to be
nuclear propulsion at this point again something we haven't
really developed yet, because we couldn't carry that much
fuel, obviously. liquid oxygen would be way too heavy to
carry all the way to mars. the bigger issue is once we get
there, we can't carry oxygen or water or food to stay there
three years, so we're going to have to do all of that on
the surface of the planet. and think of it. mars is carbon
dioxide. so we can't breathe there. so we're going to have
to come up with some conversion technique to create water,
to create oxygen and then some way of growing food on the
planet itself. all of this is in the works now, but i think
it's going to take quite a few years to develop it.
</TURN>
<TURN>
you talk about the cosmic radiation. then of course there
is the zero g bone loss, almost like the eroding of bone to
humans that would be at risk as well.
</TURN>
<TURN>
absolutely. there could be as much as 50% bone loss in
astronauts in mars.
</TURN>
<TURN>
why?
</TURN>
<TURN>
during the time in mars. because when the body has -- when
there is no dpravity as there is on mars, the body doesn't
pick up the calcium in the bones, so it doesn't keep
getting the bones stronger and stronger. so they will just
lose it. they will be almost like old people even at the
age of 40.

jeff rothfeder. thank you for joining us. looks like it
will be some time before we make our way to mars. that's it
for us. but before we go, a look at what's coming up next
week. a controversial incinerator just about ready to
destroy weapons at an anniston, alabama, military facility.
what might be the risk to people downwind. that story and
much more coming up next week. coming up next on "cnn live
sunday" a look at america's storage of gas. that's followed
by "people in the news" profiling harrison ford and harry
potter. at 8:00 eastern, cnn presents road to baghdad.
