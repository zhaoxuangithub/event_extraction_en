More US troops to Iraq as Bush, Blair hold war talks = (PICTURES) =

WASHINGTON, March 27 (AFP)

Thousands of fresh US troops headed for Iraq Thursday as British
Prime Minister Tony Blair and US President George W. Bush discussed
the effort to oust Saddam Hussein, which some senior US military
officials warn could last months.

About 1,000 soldiers from the US Army's 173rd Airborne Brigade
parachuted into an airfield in a Kurdish-controlled area of northern
Iraq, establishing a base through which to bring in more troops and
tanks, Pentagon officials said.

And some 12,000 soldiers from the US Army's 4th Infantry Division,
which was supposed to have gone into northern Iraq through Turkey,
began flying out of Fort Hood, Texas, Thursday to the region, a
military fort spokeswoman told AFP.

The soldiers are to meet up with ships transporting their equipment,
which is arriving in Kuwait from the Mediterranean, where it had been
idling for weeks on navy ships awaiting Turkey's decision.

The war in Iraq could last months and require considerable US
military reinforcements to assure a victory, the Washington Post
reported Thursday, quoting senior US military officials.

Sandstorms, dangerously long supply lines and a recalcitrant enemy
"has led to a broad reassessment by some top generals of US military
expectations and timelines," the Post reports.

"Tell me how this ends," one senior officer asked the Post.

Most US army commanders believe it is critical to pause the breakneck
advance towards Baghdad to secure the supply lines and make sure
weapons are operable and troops resupplied after days of powerful
sandstorms and damage inflicted by Iraqi attacks, the Post reports.

The Post also quoted Central Intelligence Agency and Pentagon
intelligence analysts complaining that Bush officials largely ignored
their warning that Iraqi irregular forces would use guerrilla tactics
and offer significant resistance.

Publicly US officials have insisted that the war is going according
to plan, and the most advanced US forces are currently some 100
kilometers (60 miles) outside of Baghdad.

US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld dismissed worries that there
were insufficient forces in the Gulf region if the battle for Baghdad
goes wrong.

After briefing US senators on the war, Rumsfeld told reporters that
the number of forces "has been increasing and it will continue to do
so until it is finished."

Meanwhile Blair arrived in Washington late Wednesday for two days of
talks with Bush at the Camp David presidential retreat. Talks were to
focus on how to run a post-Saddam Iraq, with Washington resisting a
large United Nations role.

Blair faces an uphill battle to win Bush over to giving the UN
oversight of a post-Saddam administration, as Washington officials
are still angry at Germany, Russia, and especially France, over the
failure to secure UN Security Council approval for military action.

Blair and Bush were to hold a joint press conference at 1600 GMT
Thursday.

Britain has deployed some 45,000 troops to fight with the more than
250,000 US soldiers lined up against Iraqi troops.

Bush gave a new, stronger warning that the war could become drawn
out.

"As they approach Baghdad, our fighting units are facing the most
desperate elements of a doomed regime," Bush told cheering military
personnel Wednesday at the Florida headquarters of Central Command,
which is running the campaign.

"We cannot predict the final day of the Iraqi regime, but I can
assure you -- and I assure the long-suffering people of Iraq -- there
will be a day of reckoning for the Iraqi regime, and that day is
drawing near," he said.

At the last minute, Bush withdrew a phrase in his speech saying the
campaign was "ahead of schedule." A senior administration official
said the president had decided to be cautious.

Bush pointedly paid tribute to the 48-nation "coalition of the
willing" -- particularly Britain -- that is publicly backing the
campaign.

Separately, US Secretary of State Colin Powell emphasized US
determination to pursue the military campaign despite the diplomatic
pressure Washington faces at the United Nations.

"We are interested in concluding this conflict, not having a pause
right now or stopping right now, but concluding this as quickly as
possible so we can get on with the rebuilding of Iraq and putting in
place a better system of governance," Powell said in an interview
with the Al-Jazeera Arab television network.

Powell, the most moderate member of the Bush cabinet, said he fully
agreed with the president's policy on Iraq and had no plans to leave.

"Personally, I'm very much in sync with the president and he values
my services," he said in an interview with National Public Radio.

Meanwhile the Wall Street Journal reported that several British and
US oil companies have quietly advised US and British forces on how
oil fields operate so they could safeguard the fields in Iraq.

The companies, including Britain's BP PLC and the Texas-based Boots
and Coots International Well Control Inc., were not paid for their
consultations, but allied military engineers said their advice was
critical.
