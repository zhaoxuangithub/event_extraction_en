<SUBJECT> Holocaust Day </SUBJECT>

Yet again I notice that the media see gays as 'invisible' when it comes to
Holocaust Day.
This morning, when talking about the horrors of Auswitch on the BBC
Breakfast programme, they referred to the slaughter of thousands of Jews and
others. Surely gays and gypsies warrant more than to be referred to as
'others'. You wouldn't know anything about the slaughter of gays if you only
listened to the BBC.

I have just (in the last 1/2 hour) heard Radio Wales refer to the
millions of Jews and other minorites including Gypsies and homosexuals
who died in the concentration camps.

The 'others' were named on Radio 4's Today.

Seems that those who listen to the BBC know, but those who watch it do
not :p

As mentioned in "The Final Solution" thread, the number of men killed
for being homosexual was at the most 10-15,000. Now that's significant,
but compared to the genocide of Jews and Zigeuner it's not as
significant (though of course to the family and loved ones of those who
died every single one is significant).

Not trying to deny it happened, just trying to see some perspective. I for
one said Kaddish this morning and will do so again at dusk.

I was watching the BBC news this morning and they interviewed the man
who is going to be in charge of Holocaust Day, certainly in the future.
He very specifically mentioned gays, along with blacks and roma, and
said that he was going to try and link future Days to the dangers of
current prejudice and oppression.

This is a bit like rating Stalin and Hitler for badness purely on the
grounds of the number of deaths they were responsible for.

It's "significant" if any group of people is identified for
liquidation by the government of the country in which they live,
surely? If there aren't as many identifiable individuals from a
particular group in the general population, then by your significance
= headcount yardstick some groups are never ever going to get rated as
"significant".

In some ways, it is amazing that the Nazis were able to identify even
*two* thousand homosexuals in the Thirties. By a bitter irony, without
the burgeoning gay liberation movement in Germany (Magnus Hirschfeld
et al) the issue may not even have arisen.

That's good.
I did get an email back from the BBC saying that they understood what I was
saying and would try to be more inclusive.

I'm simply trying to get some perspective. The Holocaust of the Jews and
Zigeuner was motivated by racial prejudices. The murder of (at the most)
10k homosexuals wasn't. Most homosexuals arrested during the Nazi era were
imprisoned in normal jails. If you were homosexually oriented but did nothing
with it the law in 30s Germany couldn't touch you. The Jews and Zigeuner
on the other hand were killed simply for their ontological state.

Once again, I'm not diminishing the horror of any individual murder, just
trying to get it into perspective.

Hang on a moment up there you say

    <QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
    -) the number of men killed for being homosexual was at the most 10-15,000.
    "/>

it's shrunk, I think your agenda is showing! And that previous quote says

    <QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
    -) for being homosexual

    "/>

a rather important qualification. I think the chance of their being
only 10000 who were homosexual amongst the how ever million were
killed in the camps is rather small.

Records appear to show that 50000 _men_ were convicted of
homosexuality during the Nazi rule, finding out how many were sent to
a camp and killed there is more difficult especially as some who were
sent to normal jails were transferred to camps at the end of their
sentence, but 10-15k seems reasonable
