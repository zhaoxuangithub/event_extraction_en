<SUBJECT> Post-trip report - London </SUBJECT>

Hi All,

We *just* got back into Washington last evening, after our brief 5-day
trip to London. Thanks for all of the responses to my earlier
inquiries, I'm happy to report that everything went pretty well, but
both my wife and I are pretty beat/tired.

We got into Heathrow on Monday morning. At the airport, I got some cash
from the Barclays ATM just outside the arrival area, as many have
suggested. FYI, I just checked my bank account, and we got charged a
$2.00 fee and the exchange rate was around $1.92/GPB.

After that, we took the underground into London. Zone 1-6 all-day pass
cost 5.40 GBP each. That was pretty easy... the most difficult part was
finding the hotel once we finally got off at the final tube station.

The hotel was nice enough to let us check in, even though we were a bit
early (we got in around 12:30, normal check-in time was 14:30), which we
were really grateful for, after dragging our bags for a couple of
hours. After settling into the hotel room (my wife is an "unpack
everything-and-stow it" type of person), we went to do a little
exploring. Being that this was a holiday, a lot of the local places
were closed (including restaurants in the hotel), but we found a kind of
combo newsagent/foodstore nearby, and we picked up a 5 GBP calling card
(for calling home) and some drinks (1.59 GPB for ~2 liter Pepsi light,
.98 GBP for a ~2 liter water).

It took us awhile, but we found a restaurant/pub (White Swan) that was
open. It seemed like a kind of local place, and the woman that was
running the place was very nice. When we walked in, we stood around
waiting to be seated :), and she said "this is a pub, sit anywhere, and
order at the bar". I gathered (from that and a few visits at other
pubs) that that's the norm. Anyway, we had a nice late lunch: fish and
chips (with "mashed peas") for me, and a beef pie for my wife. FYI,
this was probably the most reasonable meal that we had during our whole
visit.

That night, we walked around the area around the Victoria underground
station, because we were suppose to meet up with a tour the next
morning. While there, we found a local Sainsbury (kind of a small
supermarket) about 2 blocks from the underground station, and stocked up
on some cheese, milk, and croissants. Prices here were a bit cheaper
than the local foodstore, and during our trip, I made several trips here
:).

We weren't sure what we wanted to eat for dinner, so we just wandered
around a bit, and finally ended up at a "steakhouse" near the
station...big mistake. The food, service, and prices were very bad... I
guess we should have figured that one out when 3 other parties walked
out AFTER being seated, but unfortunately, we had already ordered, so we
felt kind of obligated to finish. I don't know if this is the case with
all "steakhouses", but we stayed away from them all after that :(.

We took an all day bus tour (Evan Evans), including the London Eye.
Took the underground to Victoria, and walked to the Victoria Coach
Station (it's NOT the same :)). I thought that the tour was a pretty
good way to get introduced to part of the city. We got to see a lot in
a short time, including extended tours of Westminster (felt kind of
strange walking over dead people) and the Tower of London (neat!). This
tour included lunch at another pub near Trafalgar Square (more beef pies
for us), and the tour guide was very good, and kind of funny. It was
kind of like travelling with a "grand dad" and he did his best to keep
us all together. At the end of the land tour, we went on ride on one of
the Thames cruise boats (warning, it is FREEZING on the top deck...),
and then a ride on the London Eye. All in all, recommended, but
afterwards, both my wife and I agreed that an "all-day" tour was too
exhausting (even on a bus tour, you have to do a LOT of walking
especially getting to the Changing of the Guards and at the London
Tower), and we probably would've preferred breaking it into 2 1/2 day
tours.

We also took one of the hop-on/hop-off bus tours (the "Original") on one
of the other day, as we thought it was the easiest way to get around to
the places that we wanted to re-visit. A couple of comments: take the
one with the live guide if you can, as it's much more interesting than
the ones with the recorded commentary (you can ask questions). Also, if
you want to get a seat on the top deck, take one of the earlier buses,
as at least when we were there, it was impossible to get a seat on top
later in the day, and you can't see much from the lower (enclosed) deck
(but it's much warmer :)!).

We had been buying the 2-zone all-day tube passes (4.20 GBP each)
everyday, just to get around to dinner and shopping on our own, but by
the time this was all over, my wife didn't feel like taking the
underground back to Heathrow, so we had asked the hotel conceierge to
make a reservation on an airport bus (15 GBP each), but he instead
offered that he could get us a private car direct to the airport for 35
GBP, which is what we did. This was perfect, because it got us
door-to-door from the hotel to LHR Terminal 3 with no hassles at all. I
wouldn't have done that from LHR to the hotel, but since the concierge
was arranging it, I felt that it'd be safe, and the driver turned out to
be pretty nice.

Overall, it was an enjoyable, but really exhausting trip (we live in the
suburbs, so I guess we're not use to walking everywhere).

Luckily this wasn't a "shopping" trip, because things are (at least from
Americans) really expensive. I think that if I was dealing in GPBs all
the time, it wouldn't seem so bad, but I remember sitting at the ice
cream ("gelato"?) counter at Harrods, and watching two little kids, each
eating some sundaes that cost 15 GPB each ($30.00), and thinking
"wow!".

Oh dear! Spot the Americans! :o)

Angus Steakhouse by any chance? I have never heard anything but bad
stuff about them. They are not British in the food sense, that's for
sure. Pub food is usually a good bet in the UK.

That's a Europe thing. The cities invariably involve a lot of walking,
and this is seen as a pleasure, not a task.

That's very expensive, even by London standards. Harrods is Harrods
though, and most people go there to be blown away by the prices. Of
course everyone feels compelled to buy 'something'. I opted for a few
chocolates, which were very good.

Good report of a good trip, even if you did fall for a couple of the
tourist traps!
