cnn has learned osama bin laden sent a private letter to his followers
in february, ordering them to attack the u.s. and its allies. a month
later, u.s. and pakistani troops zeroed in on bin laden's location,
but he escaped. intelligence sources in asia say the message was taken
by couriers from an area along the pakistan/afghanistan border, where
bin laden is believed to be hiding. the message was spread to al qaeda
members in africa, the middle east and asia.
