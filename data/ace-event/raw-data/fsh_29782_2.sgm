13. War in Iraq The US is currently engaged in major fighting in
Fallujah, Iraq.  Much of the country is unstable, but national
elections are still scheduled to take place in Iraq in January. Do you
think the US is doing the right thing in Iraq?  If not, what should we
be doing intstead?  Do you think the elections scheduled for January
will take place, and if not, then what?

Exactly. Exactly, they would definitely know.  Well, you he- you hear
these people saying that, I mean, that are in the mili- military you-

<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
And he- -- That's bad when, you know-

<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
And and and to me, to let people die because so your friends
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
you know your politician friends and whoever other friends can make

</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Exact- they're -- greedy. Greedy greedy greedy.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
You know- -- Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, and and here are these military guys
giving their lives, and working hard every day through training and
stuff even if there isn't a war,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Exactly.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
and you're paying them piss -- because I don't know if you watch the
news a lot, but,  uh, like, last summer they showed military people
standing on lines for, like, getting food and stuff that they don't
get paid enough -- to where-
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Yeah, they said that there were some -- yeah, I s- I saw a story about
that where they- where they're-
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
Yeah, it was, like, on twenty twenty or something.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
yeah, they're- where they're coming home from the war and they --
yeah, they're- they're pretty much homeless and- and ha- they have
nothing.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
Yeah.  Yeah, so what the hell is going on? You know, you're sending
these guys over there and you want them to be at peace of mind, you
know, they- you want them to be able to fight, you know,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
That's- -- Eh, yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
and to be able to save their lives and they're worried about their
families. You know, that's just --
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Yeah, and they c- the come home to nothing after g- all they've gone
through they come home and they have nothing.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
you can't do that.  Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
That's just -- eh, that's just pathetic.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
That's what -- you know, that's what people need to, you know, speak
up about and nobody- nobody ever does. And- and it's like a, you know,
I don't know if you remember, but it was like
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Nobody does.  I know.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
right -- a little bit right after the war started in Iraq there was a
soldier that spoke out and he got reprimanded for it.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Yes, I do remember that. Yes, he got, um,  he- well, one, uh --
somebody, like, left didn't they? They just -- he was, like, one of
the major-
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
Yeah, but this was another guy. He just -- he repri- you know, he- he
just,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
it was -- another guy.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
uh, spoke out against the war publicly and he got reprimanded for it
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
and it's supposed to be a big no-no. But, you know what,  they have
every right, you know. What happened to America?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Yeah, it's freedom of speech. I mean, we used to have to right to say
what you-
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
Yeah, we're over there supposedly helping Iraq, and I don't think
those people care either --
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
No, I don't think they-
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
I mean, uh, some of them do -- but then most of the idiots are the ones
that are causing these problems. If it was -- -- if it -- if they
thought that it was such a great thing,  then why aren't the people
helping us? You know,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Exactly.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
me as a person, if some- if someone came over and was helping me, me
as a person whether I was in the military or not, I would be helping
and I'd be going around saying, look idiots, stop bomb- you know, I
jus-
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Right.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
uh, instead of -- it- it seems like every time they do a news report
there is even the average m- Joe Schmo over there is complaining, you
know.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
E- exactly, and it- it just makes you wonder h- eh, what really is, I
mean, what is it really like in there? Why aren't they -- why aren't
they coming to er-
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
Yeah, and if they're not going to be grateful, then what the hell.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
What the hell are we doing over there? Yeah, wh- they- why aren't they
appreciating us a little more.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
Yeah yeah yeah. Exactly, because they really don't. I mean, they look
at us as -- the parties that are causing problems, look at us as we're
very corrupt. You have to remember, religion-wise,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Yep.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
how they are. What- they way we live is just -- totally against they're
religion.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
And that's, eh, they- the way they live is just so weird anyways, you
know, it's just-
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
Yeah.  Yeah, but they think of us as weird. ((Hold on Jen.)) You know,
so, you just, uh,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Exactly. I, uh-
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
everybody's got their own way of, you know, thinking and- and they
don't want -- the biggest problem is- is -- we're pushing ourselves on
them, you know.  They're not pushing their religion on us.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
Exactly. Exactly.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
You know, and so -- I- I guess -- I would have a problem if someone was
shoving something down my throat, you know,  saying, this is how it
should be.  And- and that's -- and that's how we're- we are. We're
going over there, we're saying,  look, this is how we do it -- and, um,
i- -- so we think everybody else should be that way.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
D- do you know much about the -- what- what is the elections going on
in January? Do you know what going- I-
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
I- I really hadn't paid attention. I know that it's supposed to go on.
I know that,
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
I- -- -ther.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
um,  one of the other countries, I can't think of the name, tried
doing it and then it was a big -- they had a big -- problem because they
said it was a,  um, that it- -- the guy shouldn't have won. I forget
which country that was. Oh, Afghanistan did a
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> A </SPEAKER>
-ghanistan.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> B </SPEAKER>
In ele- election, and they had a problem with who the leader was, and
