Turkish party leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan named prime minister, may
push to allow in U.S. troops

The charismatic leader of Turkey's governing party was named prime
minister Tuesday, a step that probably boosts chances that the United
States will get permission to deploy troops in the country along
Iraq's northern border.

Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who favors the deployment, hinted that he will
reshuffle the Cabinet, but gave no indication if he would purge
officials who opposed letting in the troops as analysts have
suggested he might do.

Erdogan is extremely popular in Turkey and is likely be one of the
few leaders with enough clout to unite his party and gain public
support for allowing in the U.S. troops. Turks overwhelmingly oppose
a war  _  by 94 percent, according to some polls.

Earlier this month, the Turkish parliament shocked the United States
by rejecting the deployment by just four votes. Erdogan has hinted
that he will resubmit the resolution for approval, which could take
another week.

The United States is pressing Turkey to act quickly. Ships carrying
equipment for U.S. troops are already waiting off the Turkish coast

In Washington, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Richard Myers told
a Pentagon news conference Tuesday that the United States would
``have a northern option whether or not Turkey fully supports all our
requests.

``I'm not going to talk about the operational ways of doing it, but
just be assured there will be a northern option,'' he said.

Also in Washington, Turkish Ambassador Farouk Logoglu told The
Associated Press that the U.S. and Turkish militaries were holding
informal discussions on the use of Turkish airspace.

The troop-basing resolution would allow the United States to use
Turkish airspace. If the resolution is not passed, Washington would
likely want to use the airspace for strikes against Iraq and for
airlifting troops to northern Iraq.

Refusing access to the troop deployment would mean Turkey would lose
a US$15 billion U.S. aid package that Washington has offered to help
cushion the country's economy if there is war.

It would also threaten Turkey's possible role in the future of Iraq.
Turkey, which fears northern Iraqi Kurds may declare independence in
the aftermath of a war, has been pressing for a say if Saddam Hussein
is ousted. Secession by Iraqi Kurds could inspire Turkey's rebel
Kurds, who for 15 years have been fighting for autonomy.

After he was elected, Erdogan said Turkey wanted assurances from the
United States on its role in Iraq.

Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said Tuesday there had been
talks that Turkish troops could be deployed ``a short distance from
their border to try to avoid refugee infiltration.''

Iraqi Kurds fear that Turkish troops could move deep into the
autonomous enclave in northern Iraq and have threatened clashes.

Rumsfeld also said that like Turkey, the United States doesn't want
to see a breakaway state: ``Our interest, needless to say, is to see
that Iraq remains a single country,'' he said at the Pentagon news
conference.

Prime Minister Abdullah Gul resigned earlier Tuesday to make way for
Erdogan, who won a parliamentary seat in by-elections Sunday. Gul
will remain as a caretaker prime minister until President Ahmet
Necdet Sezer approves Erdogan's Cabinet, a move that could happen as
early as Wednesday.

Erdogan said he would submit his Cabinet list to the president ``as
soon as possible,'' and leaders of Erdogan's Justice and Development
Party met Tuesday evening.

When asked about possible changes in the Cabinet, Erdogan said:
``Perhaps there will be a small amount of change, a certain number of
revisions.''

Gul's resignation had been long expected. Erdogan heads the party but
was constitutionally barred from running in November elections
because he was jailed in 1999 for anti-secular activities. The
Justice party changed the constitution after taking power in the
elections.

Erdogan, a leader of Turkey's pro-Islamic movement when he was
jailed, said he moderated his policies in prison. His party considers
itself conservative and no longer uses the word 'Islamic' in its
literature.

He now also advocates letting in U.S. troops for a war against Iraq
even though it is a fellow Muslim state.

Unlike the soft-spoken Gul, Erdogan has a reputation as a fighter.

``Erdogan will be willing to engage in a bruising confrontation in a
way that Gul was not willing to,'' said Bulent Aliriza, an analyst at
the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.
``If Erdogan decides that for his own reasons, and not U.S. pressure,
he wants this, he will push it through.''

Tensions over the basing agreement spilled over into parliament
Tuesday when opposition deputy Ufuk Ozkan shouted ``You are all
American lackeys!'' at members of Erdogan's party, the Anatolia news
agency reported.

A furious Justice party member, Fehmi Husrev Kutlu, rushed toward
Ozkan, bumping into him and sending his eyeglasses flying, Anatolia
reported. Other legislators surrounded the two to head off a brawl.
