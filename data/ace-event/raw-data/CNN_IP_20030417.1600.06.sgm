Two Americans who gave their lives to Operation Iraqi Freedom were buried
at Arlington National Cemetery today. Marine Lance Corporal Patrick Nixon
was one of 17 killed in an ambush near Nasiriyah on March 23. He was 21
years old and the first Tennessean to die in the war. And Idaho Air
National Guardsman Major Gregory Stone was buried with honors at
Arlington. He died of injuries from a grenade attack by a fellow soldier.
And that is it for this special edition of INSIDE POLITICS. I'm Judy
Woodruff. We thank you for joining us.
