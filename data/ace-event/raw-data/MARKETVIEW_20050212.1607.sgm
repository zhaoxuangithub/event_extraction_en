I've been keeping a careful eye on the Blockbuster / Hollywood
machinations for a while (and well I should -- I have stock in one of
the deal's participants, Movie Gallery ), but even so I'm surprised that
Blockbuster's latest gambit is to buy up Hollywood's debt . It's an
admirable hedge -- if Movie Gallery wins, it could improve Hollywood's
rating, and either way it offers Blockbuster some leverage. And this is,
as far as I know, the first time since the Allegheny deal that there's
been a hostile takeover using debt.
