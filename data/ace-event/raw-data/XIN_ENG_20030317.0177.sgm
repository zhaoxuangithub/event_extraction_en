ADDIS ABABA, March 17 (Xinhua)

Interim Chairperson of the Commission of the African  Union (AU)
Amara Essy has strongly condemned the coup d'etat that took place in
the Central Africa Republic on March 15, 2003.

According to a press release of the AU on Monday, Essy said AU
"rejects and unequivocally condemns unconstitutional change of
government in keeping with the provisions of its constitutive act as
well as the decisions and declarations adopted by the Algiers and
Lome Summits."

In conformity with the Lome Declaration, the release said the AU
Central Organ of the Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management
and Resolution will meet very shortly to consider the situation and
the measures to be taken.

Last Saturday night, rebels in the Central Africa Republic, captured
the airport in the capital city of Bangui and the residence of 
President Ange-Felix Patasse, who is out of the country.

The rebels have captured the country's main international airport,
said a top official in a 300-strong African security force policing
the city.

The rebels identified themselves to residents in the city as troops
loyal to former general staff  Gen. Francois Bozize, who staged a
foiled coup bid in October.
