SEOUL, April 25 (AFP)

US allegations that North Korea admitted to possessing nuclear
weapons triggered alarm across Asia Friday and prompted appeals for
calm from world capitals.

The admission, according to US sources, came during three-day talks
in Beijing which concluded Friday, the first meeting between US and
North Korean officials since the nuclear crisis erupted six months
ago.

China expressed hopes that both sides would keep the dialogue alive
while officials in Moscow and London called for patience in resolving
the complex impasse.

South Korea and Japan were cautious, with Seoul Foreign Minister Yoon
Young-Kwan saying if the North Koreans were telling the truth, it
would represent a "major" threat to peace in Northeast Asia.

US sources with authoritative knowledge of the Beijing meetings said
the head of the North Korean delegation Li Gun had confirmed to US
envoy James Kelly that the Stalinist state had developed nuclear
weapons and hinted it may sell or use them, depending on US actions.

"They said what we always knew, that they do have weapons," one US
source said. "That doesn't shock us, we have been saying it. Now they
have said it."

Li also told Kelly that North Korea had gone ahead with reprocessing
8,000 spent fuel rods at its Yongbyon plant, which could produce
enough weapons grade plutonium for several more nuclear bombs, said
the sources who requested anonymity.

An angry US President George W. Bush accused Pyongyang of reverting
to blackmail following the nuclear admission and North Korea fired
back with a charge that Washington had rejected a "bold" plan to
resolve the six-month-old impasse.

The outcome of the talks plunged financial markets into freefall in
Seoul with analysts saying they saw no sign of a recovery any time
soon.

Despite the leaked details about the meetings, US officials publicly
declined to confirm any of North Korea's announcements, with US State
Department spokesman Richard Boucher saying comments made by North
Koreans "require careful analysis."

China, playing host to the talks, tried to put a positive spin on the
talks which Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing said signified "a good
beginning."

"We hope that all sides can continue to make efforts to peacefully
resolve the Korean nuclear issue," Li was quoted by the official
Xinhua news agency as saying.

He said Korean nuclear issue was "very complicated and sensitive,"
but the key was to "not mind the other side's rhetoric," but "pay
attention to its actions."

A top Russian foreign ministry official called for patience and
Britain's Foreign Secretary Jack Straw echoed the call in a BBC radio
interview.

Kelly, the US assistant secretary for East Asia and Pacific Affairs,
arrived in Seoul from Beijing Friday to brief Yoon, the foreign
minister.

"If it is true that North Korea possesses nuclear weapons, this would
be a major breach of peace on the Korean peninsula as well as in
Northeast Asia," said Yoon.

Kelly, who declined to talks to reporters here, travels to Tokyo
Sunday for talks with Japanese officials. He has made no public
comments so far on the Beijing talks.

However US Secretary of State Colin Powell said the talks had
featured "strong views" on all sides and insisted that the United
States would not bow to blackmail, threats or "bellicose statements."

North Korea, in its first official comment on the outcome of the
talks, accused Washington of ruling out Pyongyang's "bold" plan for
peace while offering nothing new itself.

A North Korean foreign ministry spokesman, quoted by the official
Korean Central News Agency, made no reference to the reports that
North Korea had admitted to possessing nuclear weapons.

"At the talks the DPRK (North Korea) set forth a new bold proposal to
clear up bilateral concerns of the DPRK and the US, and the parties
concerned with the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, at the same
time," the unnamed official was quoted as saying.

"The US, however, repeated its old assertion that the DPRK should
'scrap its nuclear program before dialogue' without advancing any new
proposal at the talks."

The official did not disclose what North Korea's bold plan was.
