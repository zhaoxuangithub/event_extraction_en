Coalition Troops Penetrate Outskirts of Baghdad

<SPEAKER> WOODRUFF </SPEAKER>
We've been hearing about the situation in northern and southern Iraq. Now
to central Iraq, where coalition forces say they are now in charge. And
they are coming across some major munitions finds. The caches were
apparently abandoned by retreating Iraqi forces. One such cache turned up
in the city of Karbala, a strategic military point about 60 miles to the
south of Baghdad. CNN's Ryan Chilcote is embedded with the 101st Airborne
Division, and he has the story.

<TURN>
<SPEAKER> RYAN CHILCOTE, CNN CORRESPONDENT </SPEAKER>
Can you show us what you've been finding today?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> SGT. 1ST CLASS LARRY CLARK, U.S. ARMY </SPEAKER>
Roger. Well, this is about the third cache we've found today. We've been
finding them nonstop, and it's a really tedious affair. I've got an
assortment of weapons right here, ranging from AK-47s, to over here,
behind them, you'll see mortar sights, 60-millimeter and 81. Off on the
far left, you'll see a second-generation starscope, kind of outdated, but
still works. If you keep shifting over, you'll see stabilizer fins for
mortar rounds. On the back here, you'll see both 60- and 82-millimeter
mortars.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> CHILCOTE </SPEAKER>
These are well equipped.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> CLARK </SPEAKER>
Well, they're very well equipped. Definitely put up a fight.
Rocket-propelled grenades. Been finding a lot of these lately. These
could take out a Jeep or a Humvee in a heartbeat.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> CHILCOTE </SPEAKER>
Now, is this a -- you said you'd seen a lot of weapons caches recently
found.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> CLARK </SPEAKER>
(UNINTELLIGIBLE).
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> CHILCOTE </SPEAKER>
Is this a large cache?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> CLARK </SPEAKER>
No, I'd say this is about a medium cache. What...
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> CHILCOTE </SPEAKER>
This looks like a lot of weapons.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> CLARK </SPEAKER>
It looks like a lot of weapons, but it's really not. This -- technically,
this would probably would outfit a platoon, a platoon of
(UNINTELLIGIBLE).
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> CHILCOTE </SPEAKER>
OK.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> CLARK </SPEAKER>
Keep going on. This is a little bit more advanced, these are
25-millimeter shells, and each one of those silver boxes you see behind
them hold 50 of these shells. That's a little bit above us. That's
actually going into mechanized and armor.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> CHILCOTE </SPEAKER>
All right. And you were talking about the makers, where some of these
weapons are coming from, and you were expressing surprise to me.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> CLARK </SPEAKER>
Roger. A majority of these are coming from -- (UNINTELLIGIBLE) on this
box, but Jordan and France. We have a very scattered, limited, and
Russian equipment, but like I said, France and Jordan are the main
suppliers right here.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> CHILCOTE </SPEAKER>
Now for your guys, this is dangerous work, finding...
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> CLARK </SPEAKER>
It's -- yes, it's extremely dangerous, because once you enter these
buildings, we found, actually, enemy, you know, guarding these sites.
Don't know if they're going to be booby trapped. Don't know what --
what's going to be there. So it's very tedious, it's -- got to be careful
about it.
</TURN>
(END VIDEOTAPE)
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> WOODRUFF </SPEAKER>
Well, we've heard a whole lot about Iraq's use of human shields in
defending key sites. Coalition fighters, though, use a different kind of
shield. In a CNN exclusive, CNN's Kyra Phillips offers us a ride-along
over the city of Baghdad with some airborne bodyguards.
</TURN>
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> UNIDENTIFIED MALE </SPEAKER>
We won't consider the mission a success unless the Marines are happy with
the product.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> KYRA PHILLIPS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over) </SPEAKER>
They are coalition bodyguards over Baghdad, an airborne shield to U.S.
Marines.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> UNIDENTIFIED MALE </SPEAKER>
Let them know what's coming. Let them know if anything is coming back
behind them on their franks to close off the supply lines.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> PHILLIPS </SPEAKER>
You're now airborne over Iraq with Commander Steve Kroto's (ph) Gray
Knights, the Navy's P-3 eyes in the sky.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> UNIDENTIFIED MALE </SPEAKER>
Any kind of forces that look like they may be threatening the Marines,
you know, we want to let them know. And we have the capability to send
pictures or actual video, and then they can make (UNINTELLIGIBLE) if they
want to maybe avoid that area or go ahead and go out and engage those
folks.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> PHILLIPS </SPEAKER>
Dodging missiles and triple-A fire is something new to this squadron.
However, protecting forces on the ground isn't. (on camera): These men
are about three hours into their mission, and the sun is starting to set.
They've just come across one of the Marine convoys that they need to
track, so they're watching every move that the Marines make as they move
towards Baghdad, making sure they don't come across any type of threat.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> UNIDENTIFIED MALE </SPEAKER>
We're getting closer to it.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> PHILLIPS (voice-over) </SPEAKER>
Also on this mission, Marine Colonel Jim Lukeman (ph) and Sergeant Emilio
Hernandez. They are tracking and talking to their fellow Marines on the
ground...
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> UNIDENTIFIED MALE </SPEAKER>
Two vehicles move across the bridge...
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> PHILLIPS </SPEAKER>
... making sure they don't get ambushed.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> UNIDENTIFIED MALE </SPEAKER>
I'm looking for enemy positions out to the front. We'll look at the
routes ahead of where our guys are going to go and try to see what enemy
is there.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> PHILLIPS </SPEAKER>
Lukeman is warning his troops about a bridge ahead. He doesn't like what
he sees. The Gray Knights fly closer and grab a clearer picture.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> UNIDENTIFIED MALE </SPEAKER>
There's some vehicular traffic, so that we know the bridge is still
intact. They may be Iraqi military. So now that the Marine division on
the ground has that information, they'll take that action -- they'll take
action tactically on it.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> PHILLIPS </SPEAKER>
These flights can last up to 15 hours, but it's the minutes of realtime
intelligence that completes the mission.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> UNIDENTIFIED MALE </SPEAKER>
When you're on the ground fighting, every piece of information you've got
about what you're coming up against is golden.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> PHILLIPS </SPEAKER>
Commander Steve Kroto brings his crew home after locating enemy positions
and surface-to-surface missiles.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> UNIDENTIFIED MALE </SPEAKER>
It keeps the Marines safe. And one more safe Marine is one more Marine
that can continue on north to Baghdad.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> PHILLIPS </SPEAKER>
Flying over Iraq, Kyra Phillips, CNN.
</TURN>
(END VIDEOTAPE)
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> WOODRUFF </SPEAKER>
Coming up, we are going to go live to Fort Bliss, where the name of that
base is a far cry from the mood there today, after confirmation that more
of their own were killed on the battlefield.
