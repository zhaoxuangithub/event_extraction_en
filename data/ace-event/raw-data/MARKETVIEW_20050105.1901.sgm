Well, we don't, but we've something very much like it: A company
hitting and then rehitting lows that would have been unthinkable even
after their pull-back a year ago, accusations and proof of some
less-than-Kosher accounting, and, best of all, allegations of egregious
self-dealing by insiders. A glance at the analyst opinions shows that
they have a lone bull cheerleading the stock, and plenty of bears
hammering it.

That's evidence enough that it's underpriced; the market usually
reacts to a downgrade by dropping the stock a percent or two, but I
can't help it -- I presume most of these downgrades arose from the
classic "Well, what does your analyst think?" "He says it's a buy,"
"Well, what's it done this year?" conversation. Nobody wants to be
caught recommending a loser, and unlike portfolio managers with a Net
Asset Value report card every trading day, analysts can essentially
start fresh with each new opinion. The best analysts get noted, lauded,
and showered with cash. The worst? Well, they're still averaged in with
the rest.

And anyway, I don't consider analysts anything but aggregators of
publically-available information and echo-chambers for
previously-determined opinions. They can't really add much without
straying into the realm of inside information, and what they do add is
usually factored in the moment the report is released. Or, in an ideal
world, it should be. Thankfully, ours is a less-than-ideal, though by no
means dystopic, market, so we get plenty of opportunities to profit from
the mistakes of others. As long as the bearish opinions of analysts
weighs down on Krispy Kreme , I'll be a bull.
