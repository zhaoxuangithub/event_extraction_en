West Bank violence

JERUSALEM (AP)

Israeli troops shot and killed a 16-year-old Palestinian boy and
critically injured two children, ages 7 and 9, during conflicts in
the West Bank that erupted Tuesday as Israeli and Palestinian leaders
moved toward talks on a new Mideast peace plan.

The shootings  _  which the Israeli army said came in response to
attacks by Palestinians throwing stones and molotov cocktails  _ came
a day after Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon declared that
Israel's occupation in the West Bank must end, stunning both dovish
opponents and hardline allies.

Sharon's remarks and Israel's conditional acceptance Sunday of the
so-called ``road map'' to peace were expected to jump-start stalled
Mideast peace negotiations.

A summit between Sharon and his Palestinian counterpart, Mahmoud
Abbas, had been planned for Wednesday but was postponed, according to
Israeli and Palestinian officials, who blamed each other for the
delay. The officials said no new date had been set; Israel Radio said
the meeting would take place Thursday.

A three-way summit with U.S. President George W. Bush could take
place as early as next week, possibly in Jordan.

Israeli soldiers shot and killed a 16-year-old Palestinian boy and
wounded a 7-year-old boy after opening fire at stone throwers in the
Tulkarem refugee camp in the West Bank on Tuesday, Palestinian
hospital officials said. The army said troops fired, and hit a boy,
after a Palestinian youth threw a molotov cocktail.

In a village near the West Bank city of Nablus on Tuesday, Israeli
troops opened fire on youths throwing stones, hitting a 9-year-old
Palestinian boy in the head and critically wounding him, and hitting
two 12-year-old boys in the legs, lightly wounding them, Palestinian
hospital officials said. A 10-year-old boy was struck in the leg by a
rubber bullet, but was not seriously hurt, the officials said.

Military sources said troops were trying to break up stone-throwing
protests, but did not use live fire. The army was not aware of any
injuries.

Five Palestinian children, a Palestinian woman and a police officer,
were injured Tuesday after accidentally detonating explosives in the
West Bank city of Hebron, Palestinian security officials said. The
children found the explosives in two plastic bags under a tree and
accidentally detonated the first bag. After a police officer arrived,
the second bag exploded, seriously injuring him, the officials said.

Israeli troops killed a Palestinian teenager Monday and another
surrendered after infiltrating from Gaza, the military said. They
were unarmed and apparently looking for work. In a village near the
West Bank town of Qalqiliya, an 11-year-old Palestinian boy was
killed during an exchange of gunfire.

Also Monday, Israeli soldiers fired on four diplomatic vehicles in
the northern Gaza town of Beit Hanoun, diplomats said. There were no
injuries from the incident. Peter Lundberg, an official from the
Swedish Consulate in Jerusalem, said that two bullets hit the
windshield of the Swiss Consulate's armored car, and that small-arms
fire also was directed at other cars from Sweden, Denmark and the
European Union.

Military sources said the Israeli army had established roadblocks at
the entrance to Beit Hanoun to prevent Palestinians militants from
leaving the area. The sources said shots had been fired in the air
when vehicles tried to skirt the roadblocks.

The violence erupted after Sharon endured withering criticism Monday
from members of his own Likud Party over his Cabinet's acceptance of
the U.S.-backed ``road map'' peace plan.

Sharon indicated a 180-degree turnaround after decades of warning
that an Israeli withdrawal from even small parts of the West Bank
could endanger Israel's existence.

Skeptics, however, wondered whether Sharon's conversion was a shrewd
effort to deflect U.S. pressure in the hopes the road map would fail
before Israel had to make tough concessions.

``To keep 3.5 million people under occupation is bad for us and
them,'' Sharon said in remarks broadcast on Israel Radio.

The term ``occupation'' is anathema to the Israeli right, which
believes Israel has a legitimate claim to the West Bank and Gaza
Strip for religious and security reasons.

Palestinians and their dovish Israeli allies routinely use the word
``occupation'' when demanding that Israel leave the West Bank and
Gaza and dismantle Jewish settlements.

Palestinians claim all of the West Bank and Gaza for a state.

On Sunday, Sharon's Cabinet conditionally approved the ``road map,''
a three-phase plan that begins with a halt to violence and envisages
a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 2005.

Sharon told party critics he was committed to finding a political
solution to the conflict, including an Israeli withdrawal from West
Bank population centers.

``This can't continue endlessly. Do you want to remain forever in
Ramallah, Jenin, Nablus?'' he asked.

Likud lawmakers charged that the road map was slanted in favor of the
Palestinians and endangers Israel.

In his remarks Monday, Sharon left himself an out.

``What will happen if Palestinian terror continues? Nothing. Nothing
will happen. The Palestinians will get nothing,'' he said.

Critics have said Sharon's long-held condition that all violence must
stop before peace moves is unrealistic and guarantees failure of any
peace initiative, including the road map, thus releasing him from the
necessity of following through on his remarks.

Liberal lawmaker Yossi Sarid argued Sharon was trying to keep his
intentions murky to persuade the U.S. government that he was
committed to the plan, while his hawkish allies could assume he was
just making a tactical move to end U.S. pressure.

``Ariel Sharon likes to walk in the fog, because then no one knows
where he is headed,'' Sarid wrote in the Yediot Ahronot daily.
