Got job?

And so, I have rejoined the world of the fully employed. After
Christmas, I got a call from the wife of one of my former bosses (at my
last full-time job). She was looking for a Development Assistant at the
retirement community where she works. I started here 4 weeks ago. WM is
affiliated with, but not run or fully supported by, the denomination
I've been a part of all my life (UMC). My grandmother (who was Baptist)
lived here for a few months before she died in 1995, so I have many
connections to the job. Our offices are in one of the patio homes, and I
have my own lovely office with a window. The job's only about 12 miles
from home, and I'm going against the bulk of the traffic mornings and
afternoons. It all seems perfect and yet... Oh, I'm so thankful to be
somewhere so nice where I might actually make a difference in people's
lives, and I want to keep an open mind and hope it'll last forever, but
I have a feeling I'll be restless within a year or so. My boss is a very
nice person, but conservative and resistant to technology, i.e.
computers, internet, etc. We just got new computers a week and half ago,
and she's griping about XP (her old OS was Windows 98--mine was 95, so
I'm thrilled with the new stuff). I tell her it'll just take some
getting used to. We'll see.

I'm not making the kind of salary I was hoping to get, but it's the
best salary I've gotten thus far. When I was fulltime in radio I made a
little less, but I got quite a few remotes, which make up for not
getting a topnotch salary. I'm still doing my TV announcing and my
weekend radio stuff, so that money will help. I'm going to start
actively pursuing more voice work in the next month or so, too. My plan
is to pay off my car early, and then work on the other debts. I think
it's time to go on and fill out the adoption applications. I'm terrified
of more debt, but Mom and Dad will help with the money. I'm not sure
they realize how expensive it all is. I'm thinking we might lean toward
adopting from Guatemala, but we've still not hashed it all out. It's
almost bad making some money now, because while most of me wants to save
as much as possible, the other, smaller part is screaming loudly for
stuff, stuff, stuff!!! I've got a trial subscription to XM at work
because of the Dell computers, and now I'm lusting to have it all of the
time. G got me a nice office stereo for my birthday and it does have an
aux jack, so I could listen to it here. He asked if I wanted a car
stereo, and I said no, but I do. There are so many things I want. A
garage. A dining room set. New stuff for our house. New clothes. New
everything. But I want family more. I think part of the draw of the
other stuff is I could get it now. But I'd be paying for it later. Money
makes the world go round and round and round til I'm just dizzy.
