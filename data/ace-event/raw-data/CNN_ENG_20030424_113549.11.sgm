some u.s. troops have not had a chance to call home since
they were deployed for duty in "operation iraqi freedom."

reporter: jamie's husband jack was deployed a couple of
weeks ago. she and her daughter jordan often shuffle
through these pictures of him taken before he left. she has
no idea where her husband is now, but thanks to a little
help from a delta flight attendant, she knew he got where
he was going.

she had taken a picture of him and everything.

reporter: along with the picture, the flight attendant
wrote a letter saying she was prague for jack's safe
return. the trip to georgia was just the first leg. he got
on a flight to an undisclosed location, when jamie got a
second phone call from a flight attendant.

he asked us to call you to let you know he's okay, and she
told us that he whipped out pictures of our kids and
everything and showed all the family pictures and stuff.

reporter: jamie is not the only military wife who received
a photo and letter. her friend anna also got one. turns out
anna's husband flew out on the same flight as jack.

deal.

my husband and the rest of the military, and it's not all
anti-war.

the flight attendants, they say they'll never forget their
