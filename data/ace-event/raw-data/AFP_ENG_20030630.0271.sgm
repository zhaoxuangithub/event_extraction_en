GAZA CITY, June 30 (AFP)

Palestinian security forces returned Monday to the positions they
held in the Gaza Strip before the outbreak of the 33-month
Palestinian uprising as Israel removed all major checkpoints in the
coastal territory, a Palestinian security source said.

Police officers took up their positions across the Gaza Strip,
enjoying a freedom of movement they have not known since the intifada
exploded in September 2000, the source said.

"Palestinian police have taken over all the posts and positions they
held before September 28, 2000. It is the first time they have had
freedom of movement with cars and weapons since the start of the
intifada," the source said.

The move marked a huge step forward in carrying out the US-backed
Middle East "roadmap", which aims to end the months of bloodshed and
create a lasting peace between Israel and the Palestinians.

Following the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the northern town of
Beit Hanoun late Sunday, police took up positions there and in the
neighbouring town of Beit Lahiya, he said.

They also deployed along the border with Israel. The handover is a
credibility test for the Palestinian Authority, which must show it
means business when it comes to reining in hardline groups plotting
attacks on the Jewish state.

In another first in the almost three-year intifada, the Israeli army
allowed Palestinians free circulation on the trans-Gaza highway as
troops abandoned three major checkpoints across the coastal
territory.

Traffic was flowing freely through the Netzarim junction, just south
of Gaza City, the Kissufim junction by Deir al-Balah in the central
Gaza Strip, and the Guest House junction just south of Deir al-Balah
after the army withdrew.

The three military checkpoints on the highway, which runs the entire
length of the Gaza Strip, had transformed the trip from north to
south, ordinarily a 30-minute ride, into a grinding two or three-hour
ordeal and came to symbolise the horrors of occupation.

"Israel has implemented most of the agreement except for a few
issues," the source said, pointing out that Israel had still not
removed two military observation posts at the Kissufim junction and
the Guest House junction.

Although there was free movement along the trans-Gaza highway,
several other roads remained temporarily closed, he said.

The Karni-Netzarim road, which runs east-to-west across the route,
was still closed as was the section of the highway passing close by
Kfar Darom settlement, just south of the Guest House junction, he
said, adding both were likely to be opened in the coming weeks.

Another road, leading from the southern border town of Rafah to Khan
Yunis, would be opened within 10 days, he said.

Adressing Palestinian complaints, an Israeli military source
confirmed troops had installed a gate at the Netzarim crossing and at
the southern Guest House junction but said that they were only there
for when Jewish settlers needed to use the road.

A ban on Palestinian men under the age of 35 being allowed to move
freely was still in force but that was expected to be lifted later on
Monday or early Tuesday.

The army also handed over control of Rafah border crossing between
the Gaza Strip and Egypt to the Palestinians, security sources said.

Six Palestinian police officers were allowed to return to the
Palestinian section of the border crossing, which had been taken over
by Israeli troops shortly after the start of the uprising.

Under the 1993 Oslo accords, which granted a measure of autonomy to
the Palestinians, the Rafah border crossing with Egypt was to be
jointly managed by both Israel and the Palestinians, although Israel
had final control over the zone.

Although the crossing has, in principle, been open for movement
between the two territories -- while being frequently closed by
Israeli for reasons rarely explained -- the Palestinian section has
been manned by Israel for more than two years.
