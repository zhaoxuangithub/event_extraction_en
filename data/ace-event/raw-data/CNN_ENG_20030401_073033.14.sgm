well, quite vulnerable in some places and yet we've made great
strides. the access i had was not only at top but the people who were
on the front lines. and this is really the behind the scenes story of
everything they had been doing to make this country safer. i think we
decided on the morning of september 12th we're not going to be victim,
we're not just going to sit there. we're going to try to do something.
we're not just going to say we're lucky we didn't get attacked today.
in the ports, at the airports, even with our food supply, we have
taken all kinds of steps. but we are vulnerable. we're vulnerable
right out on the streets here. we're vulnerable in mass transit
systems because we can't involve this problem infin any lu we've made
good strides in the last we're. that's the story i try to to tell
about the men and women who have brought us this point.
