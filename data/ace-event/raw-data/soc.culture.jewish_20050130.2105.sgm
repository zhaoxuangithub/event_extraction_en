Saddam posed a threat to Saudia, Kuwait, and the British oil
protectorates along the Gulf - that is why we invaded, stupid.

The truth seems to me that the Israeli government got panicked when
Saddam announced that he would reward the families of Palestinian
suicide bombers with some 10 thousand dollars.

ROFL.
How old are you? Too young to remember the scuds Saddam's Iraqi Republican
Guards lobbed into Israel in 1991, or 1982 when the Israelis levelled the
Iraqi nuclear weapon facility?

Don't even bother asking if this guy remembers the Iraq/Iran war of
1980-1988, which when Saddam launched a land/ air invasion of Iran.
Anyone remember Khomeini's declaration in 1982 that Iran wouldn't
stop fighting until they overthrew Saddam? How about Saddam's use of
chemical weapons?

Recall that we (and the Brits) involved ourselves in that war ONLY in
1987, after attacks on Kuwaiti oil tankers.

How many Iraqis and Iranians were killed in that war? One million? Two
million?

Saddam was so unimpressed by Iraqi casualties, he invaded Kuwait barely
two years after the UN-imposed ceasefire.

This clown, however, thinks "the truth" is that it was Israel who
got panicked. Yeah, right.
