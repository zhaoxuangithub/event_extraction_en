Indonesia delays execution of convicts including Indian on death row

JAKARTA, March 27 (AFP)

Indonesia will delay the execution of six convicts including an
Indian on death row after five of them appealed to the Supreme Court
for a second review, prosecutors said Thursday.

"If we execute them now we can't bring them to life again should
their appeals for a review be granted," said Antasari Azhar,
spokesman for the attorney general's office.

The Supreme Court rejected earlier appeals for a case review from
five of the convicts. The sixth offender has only made one appeal for
a review.

President Megawati Sukarnoputri has refused clemency for the six and
asked for a speedy execution. Five of them are Indonesians convicted
of murders while the other is an Indian drug offender, Ayodhya Prasad
Chaubey.

"We are talking about someone's life or death so we have to be very
careful," Azhar said.

A convict can file a case review or appeal for presidential clemency
only after the Supreme Court upholds a sentence imposed by a lower
court.

Apart from those convicted of murder, 16 people are on death row for
drug trafficking -- 11 foreigners, four Indonesians and a Dutch
citizen of Chinese-Indonesian origin.

Indonesian courts have increasingly handed out severe sentences,
including death, for drug smugglers. Narcotics abuse is an
increasingly serious problem in the country.

Amnesty International has appealed to Indonesia to spare the lives of
convicted drug offenders and others, saying there was no proof the
death penalty deters would-be traffickers more effectively than other
punishments.

Amnesty opposes the death penalty for any crime.

Use of the death penalty is rare in Indonesia, where the last
execution was carried out in May 2001 of two men convicted of a
murder in 1989. It was the first execution for five years.

A police firing squad enforces the penalty.
