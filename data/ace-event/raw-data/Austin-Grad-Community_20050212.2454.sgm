<SUBJECT> Please welcome a new staff member </SUBJECT>

The following is from Mike Black:

Friends:

Please take some time next week to welcome a new staff member for Landmark
Education in Houston! Her name is Janine Beck, she is from Tucson, AZ, and
she most recently has been the team leader for Landmark Education programs
in Tucson (the title is Source Person). She will be the Registration
Manager for the Houston Center, accountable for causing registrations into
the Landmark Forum. I know this is a huge commitment for her, and I am
excited about the difference she will make in my life, my family, and in the
lives of the people in this part of the world.

A staff member is a graduate. One of us. They are one of us that choose to
have their life be about empowering others to live life powerfully and live
a life they love. When you say "my life is for that" then everything in you
life becomes about that. If you are married, your marriage is about making
a difference in the world. If you have hobbies, the hobbies are about
making a difference in the world. This is not an easy thing to take on.
The mountain is very steep and hard to climb. It is also incredibly
rewarding and fulfilling and gives purpose and meaning to your life. The
poet Rilke once said "the spirit wants only that there be flight, as to who
actually accomplishes it, in that she only has a passing interest". Being a
staff member is about being the one who accomplishes it.

Please take a few moments to drop her a note (I do not have an email address
for her. It will have to be snail mail), give her a call at the center, or
send her a fax and welcome her to our Center. Knowing the graduates here
appreciate her will make a huge difference for her. The phone number for
the Houston Center is 713-865-9600, toll free 800-745-1997. The Fax number
is 713-626-3677.

Thank you for your stand and for your partnership.
