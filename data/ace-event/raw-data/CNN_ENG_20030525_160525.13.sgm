as we said, earlier this week, christine todd whitman stepped doup and
now a whole lot of analysis is taking place as to why she stepped
down, the job she's done when she was in office and the job that has
yet to be complete. from our new york bureau as i was introducing a
moment ago, dan fagen, the environment writer for news day and dan,
whitman did consider herself sort of the republican environmentalist.
but now there's been an awful lot of monday night quarterback
quarterbacking taking place now that she's teped down. what do you
suppose took place here?
</TURN>
<TURN>
i think many people have watched thisstration in action and watched
chis tee whitman in action. the mystery is that she took the job in
the first place or didn't leave earlier. she was quite a misfit for
this administration, and she showed that over and over. she was not
good at all at communicating the administration's message to the
public and certainly to the environmental groups and she was even
worse at bringing the epa bureaucracy, the epa environmental policy
makers' message to this administration because she saw herself
undercut over and over.
</TURN>
<TURN>
that's interesting because leading into it, while she was new jersey
governor, she sued the epa and she was very much considering herself
to be an environmentalist, and then only to end up becoming the head
of the epa and then of course, there was a lot of criticism over
relaxed regulations. let's hear what she had to say last wednesday
here on cnn just after announcing her resignation.

i'm not leaving because of clashes with the administration, in fact, i
haven't had any. i report to the president, and he has always asked me
to give him my best unadulterated advice. we have have been on the
same page. i was never supportive of protocol because it didn't do
what everyone needs to get done as far as climate change is concerned.
i'm leaving now because it's the appropriate time to do it.
</TURN>
<TURN>
dan, do you agree with that? she says the appropriate time. do you
suppose for personal reasons or perhaps she was out of step with the
administration?
</TURN>
<TURN>
i'm sure that it was difficult for her personally, but i think the
commuter marriage perhaps would have been less stressful if everyday
she didn't see herself being undermined and overruledded. i mean if
christy whitman and the white house were on the same page, i don't
think i've seen a book large enough to contain a page that big. over
and over there were many, many instances over the last
