Uh, Roger.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Diane </SPEAKER>
Hello, I'm Diane
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Roger </SPEAKER>
Okay.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Diane </SPEAKER>
I'm from Lufkin, Texas. Where are you from?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Roger </SPEAKER>
Uh, Atlanta, Georgia.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Diane </SPEAKER>
Georgia? Okay.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Roger </SPEAKER>
Mhm.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Diane </SPEAKER>
Oh, tell me about your workplace.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Roger </SPEAKER>
I was going to say, you go first.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Diane </SPEAKER>
Okay, it doesn't matter. You can or I can.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Roger </SPEAKER>
You can go first.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Diane </SPEAKER>
Okay. I own a restaurant.  And uh
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Roger </SPEAKER>
Oh those are good.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Diane </SPEAKER>
Yeah. Seventeen people employed there.  Um -- predominantly Hispanics
work in the kitchen area.  They're uh -- well, actually, you know
they're some of my cake decorators in the bakery area too. They're
it's it's predominantly a Hispanic run organization. I'm not Hispanic,
but they uh I've hired uh
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Roger </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Diane </SPEAKER>
a couple that worked out quite well, and then I've let them -- recommend
family members and friends, and that seems to have been a really -- good
setup, because they're -- recommending people that they know work well,
and -- you know, it's it's uh and they're happy with who they're working
with. And I've sort of left some of that up to them. I've got a a
manager that -- you know, she's -- I defer to her on who thinks whether
she thinks I should hire somebody or not. And I've had really good
luck, because the restaurant business typically um
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Roger </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Diane </SPEAKER>
does not keep people very long. It's a short term employment, and I've
got people that's been with me for eight, nine, ten years now.  You
know, long term employees, so
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Roger </SPEAKER>
Yeah.
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Diane </SPEAKER>
it's -- it's been a good setup.  Um -- you know, I've got the older ones
typically are the ones that run the different departments, you know
the the -- deli area or the bakery area or the up front area, and -- the
new ones kind of defer to them, and -- it sort of runs itself. I feel
really lucky. I've got a I've got a really good crew.

<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Roger </SPEAKER>
Yeah.

</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> Diane </SPEAKER>
And she's uh -- hard worker, always there, um -- everybody -- She works
with everybody rather than just telling them what to do, and they
