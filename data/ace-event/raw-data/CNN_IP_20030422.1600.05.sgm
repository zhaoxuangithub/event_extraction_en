And this final story: retired Senator Strom Thurmond has never made a
secret about his fondness for young, pretty women. So some think
Thurmond's travel plans in South Carolina next month are rather fitting.
He'll fly to his first public appearance since returning to his home
state aboard the private jet of a Hooters Air executive. Hooters Air is a
spin-off of a restaurant chain known for its scantily clad waitresses.
But a local Republican official insists there will not be any Hooters
girls onboard with the 100-year-old Thurmond. Smiles. That's it for
INSIDE POLITICS. I'm Judy Woodruff. Thanks for joining us.
