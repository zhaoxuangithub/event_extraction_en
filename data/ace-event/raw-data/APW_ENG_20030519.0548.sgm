Jordan rejects government critic's bid to run in June 17
parliamentary elections

AMMAN, Jordan (AP)

Jordanian authorities on Monday said Jordan's first female lawmaker
was ineligible to run in June 17 parliamentary elections following
her conviction last year over publishing information that harmed the
government's reputation.

Toujan Faisal, 54, said she was informed of the refusal by an
Interior Ministry committee overseeing election preparations.

``The excuse is invalid because I've been convicted on political not
criminal grounds, which doesn't violate my right for contesting the
elections,'' Faisal told The Associated Press.

Faisal was convicted in May 2002 for publishing false and exaggerated
information abroad that harmed the government's reputation and
dignity. She was sentenced to 1{ years in jail.

But after spending 40 days in prison, Jordan's King Abdullah II
pardoned the former legislator known for her harsh criticism of the
state.

Jordan's electoral law bans Jordanians from contesting the polls if
they were convicted of any crime, except political, and sentenced to
more than one year in jail.

Government officials were not immediately available for comment.

During Faisal's 1993-97 stint in parliament, she became known as a
fierce critic of the government and Muslim extremists and a champion
of liberal views in conservative Jordan. She lost her seat in the
1997 election.	    snm-jjh/pg
