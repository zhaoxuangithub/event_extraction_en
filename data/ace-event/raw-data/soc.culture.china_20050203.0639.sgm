<SUBJECT> When is an election not an election? </SUBJECT>

Sunnis say Iraq poll illegitimate. Are there minimal requirements
before an election can be considered an legitimate election?

The recent Iraq election was boycott by the Sunnis which constitute
about 20% of the population. For example, in a city of 200,000 only
1400 had casted their votes. Many of the 1400 were civil workers and
polices are Shiites from the south. In Fallujah, there were 5 voting
stations with only ONE vote casted.

Are their boycott reasonable? If so, should that affect the legitimacy
of the election?

Sunnis say Iraq poll illegitimate
A leading group of Iraqi Sunni clerics have said the country's landmark
election lacks legitimacy as so many Sunnis did not take part in the
vote.
The clerics had encouraged Sunnis to boycott the elections because of
the presence of US and foreign troops.

The US and Iraqi authorities, as well as the United Nations, have
hailed the election as a "victory for democracy".

But the Association of Muslim Scholars says any government elected in
the poll will not reflect the people's will.

"These elections lack legitimacy because a large segment of different
sects, parties and currents with their influence in Iraq boycotted,"
the association said in a statement.

"This necessarily means the coming national assembly and government
that will emerge from it will not possess the legitimacy to enable them
to draft the coming constitution," it said.

The group said whilst it would respect the choice of Iraqis who had
chosen to vote, it would regard the new government as having only
limited powers.

I guess ltlee is an expert on the legitimacy of an election, as the Chinese
have so much experience running elections.

No.. ltlee is pretty good to see others problem. But he don't see his
own problem or problem near him (china). That sounds like our eyes when
we are old, see things far but forget the nearby.

Remember the phoilosopher who observe the star in the sky and fall down
by kicking a rock he don't see?

Sunni say the poll is now illegitimate because they chose not to
vote.

Fundamentally, choosing not to vote is actually a vote for the other
side. If you choose not to vote, then you choose to give your
opponents all the power.

If the Sunni's were prevented, or restricted or otherwise not allowed
to vote, then they could claim illegitimacy, but since the simply just
collectively decided not to vote, then they declared the vote
legitimate of their own volition whilest simultaneously ceding power to
all non-Sunnis.

If one slices off one's nose to spite their face, then nobody should be
surprised about their complaints of bleeding.

This is another case of "well what did you bloody well expect to
happen"?

You are talking about physically restricted to vote at election day.
However, it is not the Sunni clerics' complaints. Rather, their state
reason is related to the reality that Iraq is currently under
occupation.

Does the presence of foreign troops makes them less free? Were they
consulted on setting the date of election and how to distribute seats
from the votes gain? In addition, they are restricted from moving
freely in their own country and/or their own city, would that not
restricted their election related activities?

Well, I raised the question because the situation is novel. America
invasion, occupation Iraqis are unprovoked.

Their stated reason for not voting was because the country was under
occupation. They faced, however, no pressure from the rest of the
country, nor from the "occupying" forces to stay away from the vote.

The Sunni's now claim that the vote is not legitimate because they
didn't vote. It's not their right to decide the legitimacy of the
vote.

The Sunni's had ALL the power about a year ago. Then they, the
minority, were toppled, and they used their power to intimidate and
threaten Shi'ites through the entire period. Who do you think the
insurgents were killing -- shi'ites.

If anyone has a right to call the elections "illegitimate" it would be
the shi'ites.

They were invited to participate in each such decision. They are not
restricted from moving within their own country. The Shi'ites had no
problems turning out in large groups.

The situation is hardly novel. It happened in Japan from 1945 through
1947.
