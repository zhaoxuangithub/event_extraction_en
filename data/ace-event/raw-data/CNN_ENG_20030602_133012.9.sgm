let's go live now to the launch of a rocket. atop it a
european mars observetory. mars express, it's called. let's
watch the launch. it's a little before midnight there right
now. there it goes. the mars express on its way on a
seven-month journey to the red planet, contains really two
spacecraft. an orbit ter called mars express. it will
operate orbiting the red planet for a couple of years. it
also has a lander known as beagle two, named after charles
car win which he sailed to the island and went into its bit
of fame. the eagle two will sit on the surface of mars for
about six months, if all goes well, it will dig around,
probe around, anize rocks and search for signs of water. if
you find water, you're very likely to find signs of life.
there you see some an my nation of what will happen about
seven months from now as this tiny little lander dropping
off the entire says craft is about five feet in any
direction. not much bigger than a fairly large shipping
crate. now, it will auguster into the surface of the red
planet and but those samples into various scientific
instruments. that data will be sent back to the european
space agency in germany. this is the first european mission
to mars. there have been, of course, several american
missions, one japanese and one by the zef yot union. and
with some very limited success. mars is a tough place to
explore. you'll recall december of 1988 1988 -- 1998, i
should say, the mars polar lander had a very unsuccessful
conclusion to its flight to the red planet. which was part
of a disaster mars season.
