reporter: hello, judy. during a brief phone call with their
son from kuwait on surngd the arm asked the young family
not to get into any specific details about what happened
during their son's capture and release. however, the family
did get in a company of questions about how he was treated.
they learned he lost 20 pound pounds and also their son
told them that in the last few days of his capture, things
weren't so bad but that they were very rough in the
beginning. now they are learning more details that their
son in fact was kicked and beaten after his capture, and
that his fellow pilot david williams had a knife held to
his throat immediately after an tur, according to an
interview their son was allowed to conduct with "the
washington post", who flew with him into kuwait. their son
is said to be in very good spirits now and back here in
georgia, after three weeks of not knowing exactly what had
happened to him, finally, for the very first time in three
weeks, the young family members got some sleep last night
for the first time in a long time. well, at least some

going on next to me. back on the couch again.

could finally sleep and know everything was okay.

call is one thing. but seeing their son in person is quite
another. and they are, of course, hoping that will happen
very soon. young's mother says, when she sees her son, she
plans on hugging him for a good solid half hour. back to
you, judy.

much. let's turn to jamie at ft. hood, texas, where she's
been talking with the family of chief warrant officer david

the knife at his throat, they must be incredibly relieved.

reporter: you know, judy, they have been learning more and
more as the day goes on. the focus is clearly not on their
treatment or their capture but their freedom. i was on the
phone with michelle williams yesterday, when she saw those
first pictures on cnn of her husband, and she sleeked with
delight. for three weeks she's watched and waited for some
news. the only other pictures was his abandoned helicopter.
she knew instantly when she saw it, because of the 1st
cavalry emblem and special markings it was his. it's been a
long three weeks. today is date she was waiting for. ihood
a chance to spend some time with her yesterday. this
morning on "american morning" she told us about what her
reaction was when she saw those first pictures of her
husband free.

alive and just seeing him and being able to see his eyes
and his reaction to his rescue just took a huge load off my
shoulders.

this is a true love story. the two met, michelle and david

time. both are pilots. michelle is
