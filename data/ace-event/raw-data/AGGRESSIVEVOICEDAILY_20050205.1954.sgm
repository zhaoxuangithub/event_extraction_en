We've all lived next to some pretty undesirable people at one point
or another, but I can't imagine anyone being worse than this. A Colorado
judge ordered two teen-age girls to pay about $900 for the distress a
neighbor said they caused by giving her home-made cookies adorned with
paper hearts.

The pair were ordered to pay $871.70 plus $39 in court costs after
neighbor Wanita Renea Young, 49, filed a lawsuit complaining that the
unsolicited cookies, left at her house after the girls knocked on her
door, had triggered an anxiety attack that sent her to the hospital the
next day.

Taylor Ostergaard, then 17, and Lindsey Jo Zellitte, 18, paid the
judgment on Thursday after a small claims court ruling by La Plata
County Court Judge Doug Walker, a court clerk said on Friday.

The girls baked cookies as a surprise for several of their rural
Colorado neighbors on July 31 and dropped off small batches on their
porches, accompanied by red or pink paper hearts and the message: "Have
a great night."

The Denver Post newspaper reported on Friday that the girls had
decided to stay home and bake the cookies rather than go to a dance
where there might be cursing and drinking. Zebra Report has a picture of
the good-intentioned girls. Maybe delinquency does pay off better.
