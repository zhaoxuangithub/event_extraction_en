<SUBJECT> divorce is really stupid ... </SUBJECT>

I think divorce is really stupid. It'll take me awhile to get to
thought stream that got me to that thought today.

First off, I'm remarried, divorced 3 years ago. I love my wife, and
the kids get along just fine. I don't like my exwife. But there was a
time when I did like her; in fact I loved her very much in spite of her
numerous flaws, chief among those flaws is that she's a narcicists.
But we all have some sort of personality problems ....

My wife belongs to a support group, and just for fun, they all googled
their hubbies ex's.

Somehow, this lead me to googling my ex's boyfriend, call him B. And
there he was, talking about plans with his wife and kids. Wow. To me,
B was just this one dimensional guy that was being dragged along by my
exwife. Now, he turns out to have a 3 dimensional life too. I guess
we all do. I'd like to take him out for a beer sometime. It would be
fun.

I wonder what happenned to B's son? My kids never mentioned B having a
son. B's son is apparently 16 years old, same age as my daughter. I
wonder if B had a huge messy divorce, and his ex took the kid out of
state. My ex threatened that. Ouch. Divorce really sucks. I have my
kids almost 50/50 these days, but it was a huge messy post divorce
compromise that took a year to complete. I wonder if B had to go
through some of the same kind of shit? Perhaps my exwife has more
sympathy for what its like to be a guy on the receiving end of a
divorce now?

Ok, keep googling. Oh my, the plot thickens. I found B's exwife.
Very articulate writer. This is really humorous. She wrote an article
about a divorce support group, ending it with something about Mrs. B
being happily married but she's impressed by the divorce support group.
And that was only 4 years ago! Mr. and Mrs. B had a real life too.
They shared dreams together, raised a kid, and probably had a lot of
fun together. Now I'm even more curious about the B's kid. She still
lives in town here. Maybe there was some sort of terrible tragedy???
I'll have to ask about B's kid when my own kids switch off next week.

Sometimes we want to see marriage one dimensionally. Either its bad or
good. That's total bullshit. I know my first marriage had a lot of
good adventures, a lot of friendship, a lot of love. Oh, yeah, it
wasn't perfect. My exwife is a total pain in the ass much of the time,
and I tried to let her do what she wanted, sometimes I couldn't. But,
even to the end, we loved each other. And now, I see the lost family
ties. She's lost my family, I'm slowly drifting out of touch with her
family. We both build new lives.

New lives. But you know, as long as the kids are shared, you can't
total get this exspouse out of your mental psyche. They say it takes
one year for every two that you were married. I believe that.

Meanwhile, life goes on. My wife's name is M. We're going to a bed
and breakfast this weekend, to get away, relax. M and I are slowly
building a history of our own together. We share adventures together,
we share adventure with my kids, and with our dogs. And, I take lots
of pictures. I really haven't changed very much from who I was before.
Although, the dog thing is really post divorce. Lots and lots of
pictures. Sometimes I look at the old photos, before divorce. We
smiled together, laughed, hugged. I was one of the first digital
camera users, and I have too many photos from my first marriage.
Sometimes I feel like I'm racing to create enough photos of my new life
to outweigh the long history of my first life. That's going to take
awhile... Luckily, we flawed human beings live long lives, and digital
cameras take lots and lots of pictures!

If my exwife doesn't dump B, maybe they'll wind up staying together,
maybe even getting married. I think that would be nice. And they too
will begin the process of rebuilding their "together" lives. I'm
assuming there is some humanity beneath my exwife's narcicistic shell,
but I do believe there is. B seems like a decent enough person too.
So, B and my ex will be doing the same thing that I'm doing.
Rebuilding their lives.

Anyway, all of this gets me back to my original point. Divorce seems
really really stupid. It seems to me, that beneath it all, we all want
the same things. Love, companionship, and a partner for our life's
journies.

None of this makes total sense to me. But I just thought I'd ramble.

Your post made me horribly sad.

My ex has that nice new life with the child-bride and the 2 cats and 2
dogs and new house and my son primarily lives with them even though he
ends up being at my place 1/2 the time in a 2-week period. -- I live in
a 961 sq. ft. apartment.

My ex has most all of the photos as our son lives there and it's his
history. I did get a good bunch of the wedding photos, but my ex
refused to give them all to me saying it was "his life too" even though
I really resent them being under the same roof with his child-bride.

I'm sure they are taking lots of pictures of their
trips/vacations/whatever (at least 2 that I know of). I don't own a
camera.

His new inlaws are all former family friends I don't have anything to
do with anymore for obvious reasons. His family (brother, sister,
stepmother) conveniently seem to forget that for almost 20 years I was
a member of their family. There was no gradual "drifting of out touch"
despite the fact that we all live in the same city and my ex BIL and I
even work within blocks of each other. My family thinks my ex is pond
scum but because my parents are still members at the same church, they
have to see my ex and his new wife every week. My mother took his
remarriage harder than I did, I think, because of that.

Divorce *is* really stupid. Duh-uh. Especially for those of us who
still have so many years (if one year for every 2 married, then I've
still got another 7 or so) to go to get our heads screwed back on and
find some sort of life that rivals what we had or what our ex has or
what you and your ex have. So far, this is not it. -- Barbara Sz.
