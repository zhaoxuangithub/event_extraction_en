U.S., Britain drafting resolution limiting U.N. role in Iraq to
humanitarian relief

LONDON (AP)

The United States and Britain are preparing a resolution that would
give the United Nations a role in humanitarian relief but not
peacekeeping in Iraq, a senior official in U.S. President George W.
Bush's administration said Friday.

Separately, the United States has decided to divide the military and
humanitarian relief mission in Iraq into three parts under American,
British and Polish command, the official said, speaking on condition
of anonymity. Six European countries have agreed to contribute troops
to the British and Polish sectors to create an international
stability force, the official said.

The draft resolution would limit the U.N. role to helping with
refugees and displaced people, reconstruction and humanitarian
assistance, the official said. The United States and Britain agree on
all but a few of the fine details of the resolution, the official
said, though there is no timetable on when it would be introduced.

U.N. officials are already in Iraq providing humanitarian relief.
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan said this week that the body has no
interest in policing a postwar Iraq, although it could contribute to
the political resuscitation of the country.

``Take the question of security. I don't think the U.N. would want to
take on that,'' Annan said. ``There has been a suggestion that the
U.N. wanted to take over the whole Iraq and run it, which was also
not the case.'' What the United Nations could contribute beyond
humanitarian assistance was ``political facilitation,'' Annan said.

The proposed draft resolution would probably face resistance from
other U.N. Security Council members who have favored a U.N.-convened
conference of the kind that helped establish Afghanistan's
post-Taliban government.

U.S. Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld discussed the resolution
with Prime Minister Tony Blair and Defense Secretary Geoff Hoon on
Friday as Rumsfeld returned from a tour of Iraq, Afghanistan and the
Persian Gulf region. Rumsfeld said afterward he hoped the U.N. would
play a role but did not publicly discuss the draft resolution
outlining that role.

Hoon, who joined Rumsfeld in a news conference at Heathrow airport,
also did not mention the draft resolution.

``We are right to be optimistic about the way forward'' in Iraq, Hoon
said.

International stability forces will be sent to Iraq as soon as
possible, the U.S. official said, though it was unclear when that
would be. Those troops will work to restore and maintain order and
supervise humanitarian projects such as the restoration of water and
electricity and delivery of food and medical aid.

The six nations contributing troops are Italy, Spain, Ukraine,
Denmark, the Netherlands and Bulgaria, the official said.
Representatives of those countries will meet with British officials
May 7 and Polish officials May 22 to determine what forces each
country will contribute and whether they will be put under British or
Polish command.

The U.S. part of the stability force will be comprised of American
troops. While that portion is likely to consist of a military
division  _  about 20,000  _  the troop strength of the other two
sectors has yet to be determined, the official said.

The international stabilization force would be under the U.S. war
commander, Gen. Tommy Franks.

At least initially, the coalition stability forces will augment
rather than replace the 135,000 American troops inside Iraq, the
official said. The stability forces will focus on providing security
and humanitarian relief while other U.S. troops focus on rooting out
leftover members of Saddam Hussein's government and other armed
elements in Iraq.

Rumsfeld said, however, that the more troops other countries
contribute to the stability effort, the fewer U.S. troops will be
needed inside Iraq.

Planning for both the U.N. resolution and the international security
force left out France, Germany and Russia, three U.S. allies that
vehemently opposed the war in Iraq.

Some of the NATO members who agreed to send troops may want NATO
authorization for that action, the official said. Requests for such
authorization will be routed through the alliance's defense planning
committee, which does not include France, the official said.

The outlines for the international stability force were decided at a
conference Hoon hosted Wednesday with representatives from 16
countries, mostly NATO members. Other countries including the
Philippines, South Korea, Qatar and Australia agreed to send other
help such as field hospitals, engineers, explosive ordnance disposal
teams or nuclear, biological and chemical weapons experts.

The U.S., British and Polish sectors will be drawn to take into
account ethnic, religious, tribal and political factions within Iraq,
the official said. For example, although ethnic Kurds are the
majority in large parts of northern Iraq, there are also large
numbers of Kurds within Baghdad.

Some Arab countries also want to play a role in the stability
operation in Iraq but are reluctant to send troops because of
political, religious and ethnic considerations, the official said.
Countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council have offered to donate
money for the effort.

Rumsfeld also met Friday with King Abdullah of Jordan, an American
ally in the Middle East. Defense officials say Jordan provided key
help in the Iraq war, acting as a staging area for U.S. special
operations raids into western Iraq to prevent missiles from being
fired at Jordan or Israel.

Rumsfeld did not say what the two discussed.
