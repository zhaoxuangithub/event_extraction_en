Merck posted a 21% decline in earnings thanks to the new post-Vioxx
announcement. Most of the profit decline was because Vioxx, representing
about 11% of sales, now represents a pretty severe legal headache: Not
only have they lost the revenue, but they've taken a $600 million charge
as a reserve against future Vioxx losses. If that's an accurate number,
investors should cheer up: Merck's at fifteen times annualized earnings,
twelve times forward earnings, and underappreciated by most of Wall
Street.

Full Disclosure: I own Merck. I bought the day of the Vioxx
announcement. And if I want to stay that contrarian, I'll have to sell
only when I get an inside tip that they've cured cancer, AIDS, heart
disease, and death.

If you read the quarterly more carefully, you'll notice that the
charge is not related to liabilities from Vioxx but merely costs
associated with legal defense, i.e., just the cost of paying the lawyers
in all of these cases. If thats how much they're willing to pay for
legal defense, imagine how much the actual liabilities are gonna be.

Good blog, I found you via your instalanche.

Thanks for your compliments. Usually, I don't read the filings as
carefully as I should -- I leave it up to alert readers, I guess.
Anyway, I still think the Vioxx risk is overestimated -- if the tobacco
industry can sell something with no health benefits for years, get sued,
and 1) Keep the product on the shelves, 2) Remain in business, and 3) do
2) to the tune of several billion dollars per year in profits, we
Merckers might be safe.
