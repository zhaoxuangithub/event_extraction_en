New Explosions in Mosul, Baghdad

That's something to look at. Today the Pentagon is comparing suicide
bombing attacks on coalition forces in Iraq to terrorism. Four U.S. Army
soldiers were killed when a suicide bomber attacked a military checkpoint
today in Najaf. CNN's Chris Plante is chasing all that down for us at the
Pentagon right now. Hello Chris.

<SPEAKER> CHRIS PLANTE, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT </SPEAKER>
Hi, Judy. That's right. Four U.S. soldiers from the 3rd Infantry Division
manning a checkpoint near the town of Najaf killed today in an apparent
suicide bombing. A man driving what appeared to be a taxicab came to the
checkpoint, waved soldiers over, appeared to be having mechanical
problems of some kind. As the soldiers approached, the man detonated
explosives in the car killing all four of the soldiers. This is something
that Iraqi Vice President Ramadan had said would take place. He said this
long before the conflict ever began. He reiterated today in a press
conference in Baghdad that this would just be the beginning of this that
they would plan on killing thousands of U.S. troops with suicide bombing
similar to this. Also, in southern Iraq today near Basra, two members -
claimed to be members of Saddam's Thataeen (ph) group surrendered to U.S.
troops saying that they had been ordered to carry out suicide bombings
down there but that they didn't want to die for the regime so they were
surrendering. At the Pentagon briefing today, General Stanley McChrystal
said that it looked a lot like terrorism.

<SPEAKER> MCCHRYSTAL </SPEAKER>
It looks and feels like terrorism and what it requires is units to
conduct forced production activities which they are prepared and do all
the time but clearly when you see a tactic like this, it requires strict
adherence or adjustments to your tactics, techniques and procedures to
ensure that places like checkpoints are not vulnerable. So it won't
change our overall rules of engagement. It doesn't effect the operation
at large but to protect our soldiers it clearly requires great care.

<SPEAKER> PLANTE </SPEAKER>
So certainly an unpleasant development today Judy and another item on the
docket over here today is the failure of a number of cruise missiles.
Tomahawk land detect missiles being from launched from ships in the
eastern Mediterranean and in the Red Sea have suffered a number of
failures. The Pentagon says a total of seven of the cruise missiles have
failed crashing in Turkey and in Saudi Arabia. No injuries reported. The
missiles are programmed so that they don't detonate until they reach
their target. If they go astray, then the warheads never arm but claiming
that it's about one percent of the warheads. They've fired 675 or so
tomahawk land detect missiles from ships and seven of those have failed.

<SPEAKER> WOODRUFF </SPEAKER>
Chris, very quickly, new information from the Pentagon today about any
concerns they have about Saddam Hussein's ongoing air defense capability?
</TURN>
<TURN>
<SPEAKER> PLANTE </SPEAKER>
Well, no major concern. The Pentagon says that they do have air dominance
as they now call it over the vast majority of the country that there are
certain areas and only certain areas of downtown Iraq where battle
management radars linked to surface to air missiles are still in tact.
The reason that they're still in tact according to today's briefing was
that they had not turned them on and as long as they don't turn them on,
the U.S. has trouble locating them. They assure us that as soon as they
do start turning on these radars that they'll take those out too and
finish the job in terms of airspace over Baghdad.Judy ...

<SPEAKER> WOODRUFF </SPEAKER>
All right. We're paying attention to all those details for us, Chris
Plante at the Pentagon. You're looking at live pictures of Baghdad where
there have been more strikes, more bombs dropped, more missiles this
evening and of course as always, CNN keeping a close eye, a close watch,
a close listen on what's going on in Baghdad. Coming up, coalition forces
control several parts of southern Iraq but they still face some serious
problems including pockets of resistance. That story when we come back.
Since marching into Iraq, coalition troops have engaged in some fierce
battles with Saddam Hussein's forces. A serious problem they still face
though, pockets of resistance. Reporter David Bowden is with the British
forces in Umm Qasr in southern Iraq.
